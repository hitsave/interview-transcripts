Hello everyone and welcome to yet another Hit Save! indie interview, podcast videocast, whatever you want to call it. Today I'm here with Alex Rushdy from 13AM Games. Hello, Alex. Hello. Do you want to introduce yourself a bit? who you are and what you do at 13AM Games?

Alex Rushdy  0:41  
Sure, yes. So I'm, I've kind of got two major jobs at 13AM Games. I'm the CEO. So I'm in charge of kind of business development and direction. And I'm the creative director. I mean, that's project dependent, but most recently as creative director on Dawn of the Monsters.

Jonas Rosland  1:04  
Awesome. We'll we'll dive into Dawn of the monsters a bit later in the show here. But first, I want to dive into who you are and how you got to where you are. And then we'll dive into 13AM Games a little more as well. So how did you get started in game development? How did you get to where you are right now?

Alex Rushdy  1:27  
So I, I kind of stumbled into it. I didn't intend to go into game development. I was originally I studied visual art and design with the intent to go into film and video production. And I did film and video production for about a year. I wasn't that hot on it. And I had been I'd always been interested in in video games. I always loved video games, but I wasn't really I mean, I'm from a visual art and design background. I didn't want to learn programming. It wasn't something that really jived with my skill set. And then I found out that like, oh, no, you don't have to be a programmer to work in video games. There are so many other jobs and designer is one of them. And at the time, I was actually I took a gap year I was living in the Czech Republic. I was volunteering there, at the international school. And I was it was wouldn't would have been 2012-2013. And I had kind of grown disillusioned with the current state of video games. I think that was the year that E3 had, I want to say six, kind of gray brown military shooters as the standout titles. And I was just like, Man, I like the hobby was clearly growing away from my tastes and interests.

Jonas Rosland  3:00  
Yeah, I remember that that time period as well. It was very gray, a dark brown. Yeah, it was a dark time for sure.

Alex Rushdy  3:10  
And that's when I kind of got the idea like, okay, if I'm going to complain about the video games, I don't like maybe I could try to work and make video games I do like. So I applied to study in a post grad Game Design program in Toronto, met a bunch of other truly talented people in that program. And together, we kind of founded a mock company that we called 13AM Games, we did a game jam, we created a very early prototype of our first game Runbow, and it garnered enough traction and attention that our professors and the college were like you guys should finish this game. We'll help you like we'll give you office space for a year. We'll give you computers that you can use for the year, finish the game. So we finished it, you know with the intention of okay, we'll finish the game and then we'll have a resume to get real jobs. But the game kind of got picked up by Nintendo caught wind of it. We reached out to them to show them the game and at that time with the Wii U it was like kind of exactly what they were looking for something that shows off the Wii U hardware. It was like a nine player game that you couldn't do anywhere else. And it was part of their kind of burgeoning at the time eShop initiative. They had this, this branding for indies called Nindies. We were among the first Nindies that they ever had. So it kind of worked out perfectly for us in that we were able to get a lot of coverage and support from Nintendo and the game. I mean, it was a Wii U exclusive, it didn't make a ton of money but it made it enough that we were able to keep making games and here we are some eight years later,

And Runbow was that ported to the Switch as well?

Yeah, after the Wii U, we ported it to the PC, Xbox, 3DS and then Switch and PS4 shortly after that. So pretty much everything.

Jonas Rosland  5:22  
Yeah, you're on all platforms. So yeah, what what was that process like you got a game released on the Wii U you got Nintendo's eyes on you essentially? How did that feel though? That was your first game? How did that feel?

Alex Rushdy  5:42  
It was amazing. It was pretty overwhelming. Certainly not what any of us expected. You know, it definitely felt like we were getting a ton of traction. Right. That's the way I've described it as we're getting a lot of forward, traction and momentum. Which was, which was really great. And pretty intense. We were all pretty fresh out of college at the time, we worked ourselves to the bone to get that game out in time. Our industry likes to condemn crunch from the big guys, but we like to forget about it or pretend it doesn't exist with the little guys when in reality, that's where I think like 90% of major crunching happens. We worked ourselves raw in that damn game to get it finished. Thankfully, we don't do that anymore. But that's good. That's good. We the reason we could do it is because we were also excited about it because we owned it right it was it was our game. We weren't working for someone else's company it was our game was our company. And we believed in it. So yeah, it was it was pretty incredible and pretty overwhelming for us.

Jonas Rosland  6:56  
That's awesome. So how did you go from from Runbow to your your future titles? What was the kind of the genesis of your next title?

Alex Rushdy  7:10  
So the thing about our studio is we we all came from very different backgrounds, and none of us really had experience managing a business. So we completed Rambo, and I think that we were expecting it to be a Shovel Knight success. It wasn't a Shovel Knight success. But by the metrics of like any other reasonably minded indie studio, it was pretty darn good. Especially over the lifetime of the of the game, it's, it's made a lot of money. The problem for us was twofold. One, it didn't make all of its money, right at the start. So we couldn't just be like, Okay, we have this huge chunk of change, let's put it into a new game. And the other was that like we didn't know how to structure business. So we didn't want to get pigeonholed into what to do next, we weren't sure what to do next. So we started pitching for a lot of projects that were you know, pretty much above our pay grade. We kind of like, for awhile, we kind of floundered and we didn't really have a good idea of what to build next. Until eventually we just said, Okay, let's, let's come up with a cool mechanic. Let's prototype the mechanic. And then let's try to get government funding. And if that's not enough, try to get a publisher on board built a game. And so that mechanic was initially about magnetism, and having like a 2d platform built around magnetism. And we showed it to Nintendo. And they were like, Yeah, this is cool. But like, Have you heard of Teslagrad and Teslagrad is like a 2d platformer about magnetism. So then we were all like, shit there, right? We got to rethink this. So then we, we started to play around with the idea of instead of it being magnets, it being a kind of like an energy tether. And we found out this really cool control scheme where you can have

Jonas Rosland  9:15  
a really precise method of targeting objects and enemies

Alex Rushdy  9:25  
with a energy tether, and either grabbing them or moving yourself forward and swinging around like spider man. And eventually that turned into double cross, which we released with graffiti games and really, really early 2019 It was like a January release. And we ended up kind of turning that into a a bit of a mix of 2d action platformer meets adventure game. It's a very interesting game, but it did. do very well. And I think part of that is because it was such a bizarre mix of, of concepts. And a lot of that came down to us kind of throwing everything in the kitchen sink into the design. But, you know, we learned a lot from it. And we're able to build on it and a lot of ways. And so for our next title, we went back to an early concept that we had had about a giant kaiju fighting game. And we re envisioned it as a co op title and built on monsters. And that's become one of our most critically acclaimed games have put out. So much more focus and kind of realize, vision and design. But we started that in I'd say, mid 2019, early 2019. And then we got way forward on board with the project. And, you know, then COVID happened and bing bang, boom, x three years later, almost, we were able to get it out back in March.

Jonas Rosland  11:08  
What so let's dive into that a bit. So you got way forward as the publisher, is that right? Yeah. And your team is, is everyone based out of Toronto? Or how does

Alex Rushdy  11:25  
that work? Pretty much. So before the pandemic, we actually had an office building like, like, an actual physical office, here in Toronto. And in 2020, we got rid of that. After we realized that like, oh, this pandemic is not going to, it's not just going to be a couple of weeks. Yeah. So we transitioned to work from home. And so while the majority of people are in Toronto, or in the GTA, there are a chance there's just one, our CFO, Tom, he's up in Sudbury. Because basically, during the pandemic, he was like, You know what, I'm going to buy a house in a place where a house is affordable, and he'd left her on. That's not a bad idea. Not a bad idea at all, in my opinion.

Jonas Rosland  12:18  
How was that transition from being in the office during the week and working on things and being with with colleagues and kind of working off each other? And iterating? Quickly, how was that transition to a complete remote only?

Alex Rushdy  12:36  
I think that thank you, it was very difficult. But I also feel like we probably had an easier transition than most companies in industries who were already set up over a network, you know, as far as submitting builds, and pushing and pulling and sharing content. So that was already set up. The main challenge was in how do we change how we communicate as a group. And the tool that was super helpful for us in making that transition pretty smoothly was discord. Whereas a lot of companies use like zoom and stuff. I kind of like hate zoom. I don't really like Google Hangouts. I mean, I like I like Google meetings a little bit better than zoom, I guess. But they anyways, it was all it was weird, right? It was, there's all these different tools. And the one that worked the best for us, was discord because we could basically set up virtual meeting rooms, and be like, hey, everyone come to this meeting room, or, Hey, I'm going to meet with design in the design room, the artists are going to chat in the art room. And tech is going to meet in the tech room and talk to production or whatever. It is, like at any time, we could share screens, we could do stuff that really helps. So I mean, that first thing was figuring how to communicate with with each other. As an organization and keep that communication clean. We also use Slack still, which we're already using. And then the other one was just on the more personal side getting used to the idea of working in my own home. Probably I don't know if you can see it, but like my bed is like right over there. And when we started work from home, I would have dreams where the entire company was in my bedroom working. And I was like this is yeah, it's gonna take some getting used to Yeah,

Jonas Rosland  14:45  
I mean, you essentially invited everyone into your bedroom when when you have video calls in your bedroom. I'm down here in my basement. So I invite everyone over to my basement and essentially, this is where I do my work. And also here's my couch in In all my video games are over there.

Alex Rushdy  15:02  
I see a nice big CRT. Yeah, I see you got to see our T.

Jonas Rosland  15:05  
But I knew to

Alex Rushdy  15:07  
course, of course, manatees

Jonas Rosland  15:11  
actually got one another Pat and Sony Trinitron on the floor as well.

Alex Rushdy  15:20  
I've got, I've got a Trinitron next to this one sideways, so I can play like maps and stuff.

Jonas Rosland  15:28  
That's awesome. Yeah, no, I totally see what you mean. The transition happened for us as well. So I work at VMware, large IT company. And of course, everyone just turned over to remote. I had been working remote for a while already. So it wasn't a big change for me, but it was a big change to have everyone else be remote as well. For sure. Yeah.

Alex Rushdy  15:57  
Yeah. And I, you know, I had worked. When I was working in video production, I was working, but you know, sole proprietor, I was a sole proprietor. So I would just do everything by myself. And I ended up actually renting office space, this was back in like, 2011, or something, I rented office space. So that I would actually have to go to work and keep it out of my home. And that's one of the things that I learned was, like, really important. It's like, because I'm in Gainesville. And I actually have a pretty beefy PC, right? I could run all sorts of PC PC games, but I never play games on my computer. Because this space when I'm sitting in this chair, I'm in work mode. Yeah, if I want to relax, I can either like sit on my bed and play my CRTs or have another room that has like a couch with an HDTV. And it's like I'm I'm in I'm in relaxed mode, keep them very separate. Because if they start to melt together, things get bad for me.

Jonas Rosland  16:54  
Yep, totally. I totally get that. I totally get that. So you worked through the pandemic, on Dawn of the monsters, and then you released it when?

Alex Rushdy  17:08  
In March and is March 15. Of this year.

Jonas Rosland  17:12  
Awesome. So what was the reception like?

Alex Rushdy  17:14  
The reception was, so it's interesting. I mean, overwhelmingly positive, people really loved the game. And a lot of people said a lot of really nice thing. A lot of things, you know, when you're developing a game, you're never sure if what you're making is going to resonate with people or not in the way you intend. It doesn't matter if you think it's good or not. It's just like, will it act will people actually like get it? And a lot of people did, because we were trying to like I love scrolling beat em ups. But I always felt that the evolution of side scrolling beat em ups kind of stopped when 3d beat em ups like don't make cry Ninja Gaiden started to come out. And I was like, Why can't a side scrolling beat him up have the depth and, and nuances of that kind of combat. And that's what we did with Dawn of the Monsters it plays more like Bayonetta than it does Final Fight. And people picked up on that. And they really appreciated this, the amount of content we added to try to differentiate it from other beat 'em ups on the market. And some people even said, Oh, this is this is like the next step for medium ups. And I was like, Ooh, I like to do that. So that was all good. However, it released in March 15 2022, which means it was like, I want to say two weeks after Elden ring. So getting anyone to pay attention to this game was an absolute nightmare. Really difficult to get people to even just like review it on time. super tough to push. And, and of course, I mean, we had our core of fans that were like ready for the game when it launched and stuff but getting outside of that into the general gaming like there's some beat him up said and done numbers this year, but it's like Ninja Turtles, right? You know, Ninja Turtles is a multibillion dollar franchise. Of course they they were in, you know, of course, IGN reviewed them. IGN getting IGN to review our game was like at impossible. So it was a bit of a challenging launch from that perspective, as well. So critically really, really great. But we weren't able to get as much of a response from the general gaming public

Jonas Rosland  19:39  
that we'd hoped we would get. So I've been trying this out for the past week, and I've been having a lot of fun with it. And one of the things that I really like about it is the story itself. It's not a regular beat up story. And very sci fi lots of fun. I juice. And hey, just fight monsters and you're, you're a monster yourself, you can control monsters and beat up other monsters. I mean, that's, that's really frickin cool. So I've been having a blast with it. I'm not the best I'd beat him ups. But a and it took me a while to understand the controls, and then to actually utilize the arguments that you have in there as well. And I really liked that mechanic the argument mechanic because it definitely adds kind of a personal touch to how you play with those with those arguments there. So I mean, then yeah, upgrades and skins and all that good stuff. But the arguments definitely made a big difference compared to a bunch of other beat them ups that have played

Alex Rushdy  20:57  
lately. Thank you. Yeah, that was, that was another key factor for us. In designing this game was I mean, there's a whole like philosophical discussion about difficulty in video games and stuff. And like, I wouldn't say I'm entirely opposed to the idea of like difficulty settings. But I always think there's something elegant about when a game can try to conform to what the player wants to do. And let them because like a difficulty setting, it might be like, Okay, well just reduce the health of enemies. But like, if a player struggles with the idea of dodging, or paring, it doesn't matter if the enemies are low health, they're still going to get hit. So that's one of the reasons we included augments is not only is it fun to, like build different types of characters, but you can kind of self identify, oh, man, I keep running out of rage or housing, whatever. You can be like, Okay, well, I'm gonna build my kit to to deal with that issue. Right. And I think that was, I'm pretty happy with with how that turned out. And I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed playing around with those?

Jonas Rosland  22:10  
Yeah, yeah. It's super fun. I finished the the first Toronto, not mission, but chapter. So I finished that yesterday. And as I was playing through, I got it because you get graded after every level as well when you get graded throughout the levels. And at at first I was a was just abysmal, of course. But then as I was getting closer to the end, it was like s plus. And then I think the last one, it was like an F. Because I was too slow. But it was it was really fun. And I like that the boss battle mechanic as well, because it's vastly different. It's not just a strong boss that you need to be. But you have a lot of different elements to the boss things that they do. That the boss says things they do and special attacks that you need to be on lookout for. It's it has a lot of depth. So yeah, I really, really enjoyed it.

Alex Rushdy  23:18  
That's great to hear.

Jonas Rosland  23:21  
So I know you're a big fan of big monsters I saw you have a collection of Godzilla VHS tapes.

Alex Rushdy  23:29  
Yep.

Jonas Rosland  23:32  
So I do. How did that come about? And where did this love of giant monsters come from?

Alex Rushdy  23:42  
From a very specific set of circumstances, I think. So when I was I must have been like four, four or five years old as some somewhere around that age in the in the mid 90s. And I always I love dinosaurs. I was really obsessed with them. I could name them all. I had so many books about dinosaurs. And I went to Zellers one day with my babysitter. And Zellers is just a Canadian department store. Funnily enough, I've got a Zellers mug right here. And they had a bunch of toys for Godzilla. And I was looking at them and I didn't know what Godzilla was. And I was like, I don't I don't. I was talking to my babysitter share. And I said, I don't recognize this dinosaur. What dinosaur is this? And she had grown up in Wales, and I guess, had watched all the Godzilla movies on TV. And so she was like, Oh, that's not a dinosaur. Alex, that's, that's Godzilla. What's the Godzilla and then she explained it to me and this sounds best thing ever. And I actually I still have that she bought me the Godzilla I still have it here it sits on my desk. Oh, that's awesome. And he's been thrilled that that sparked my love of, of kaiju. Because after that it was okay, well, I found all the Godzilla movies on videotape or I rented them or, or I could, you know, look through the TV Guide listings and earmark them. And and I couldn't get enough of them. And then eventually I watched all the Godzilla movies so then I had to watch gamma movies and then all of those well, okay, I now I got to watch Ultraman and, of course, King Kong, all the all the giant years. So that was a really big part of my childhood. And then I think as well things like things like Pokemon, and did you mind really just kind of further fueled that love because I mean, in many ways, those are just more kaiju. There maybe not as big but a lot of the same stuff. And, but what what I think, has kind of kept to my love of the genre, is that as I got older and would rewatch these films, they had a lot more depth for, you know, a teenage and adult audience than I expected, especially like the original Godzilla film, which is actually a pretty somber and harrowing film, but a lot of them have a lot of, they've got a lot more to talk about than you would expect thinking, Oh, this is just about giant shooters. They talk about the Cold War, they talk about environmentalism, they talk about all these headier concepts. So you know, at a base level it's really fun to look at the monsters and then a different level. It's like, Oh, these are actually like well made films that are that have something more to say than than your usual pop culture media. And so yeah, I still, every time there's anything new with giant monsters, I got to check it out on on my watch list is they just released a movie called troll on Netflix. About a giant troll that appears in somewhere in Norway. It looks great. Apparently, it's getting really good reviews. But that's that's the next giant monster on my hit list.

Jonas Rosland  27:18  
I'll have to check that out. So I'm, I'm from Sweden, and my wife's from Norway. So I'll, I'll put that on my list.

Alex Rushdy  27:25  
There you go work there. Yeah, actually, my, my. What would it be my grandmother. I guess my great grandmother and great grandfather are from Sweden. I haven't been there yet. But yeah, I've got some Swedish blood in me. Got

Jonas Rosland  27:42  
Awesome. Yeah, no, it's, it's a great place. Highly recommend visiting. Yeah. So the as I was playing, Donna monsters here. One thing that I really liked, again, adding more depth, not just the story, but then you have the archives, as well, within the game, where you can dive deeper into the lore. How did that come about? And was that to build on top of something? Was that to build on top of other betta maps that were just straight, left to right, beat everything. And then done? Did you Was that planned from the beginning to have that archive in there?

Alex Rushdy  28:28  
That that came from, from a number of kind of observation. So early on, when we knew we were going to make this game, we, I kind of lead the team on a guided tour of the genre, we would have movie nights as pre pandemic, we'd have movie nights, every week. And we would watch a monster movie or a TV show and then we discuss it to try to understand or target on. And one thing that I've always felt when it came to other, not not necessarily other beat him up. So I mean, that could be the case. But other other giant monsters, like there have been Godzilla gain from end games is that the only thing that they do a good job and sometimes not even great of a job of doing is trying to create monster action. Sometimes they're pretty mindless times they're pretty simple. And it was always strange to me because being in this fandom of giant monster movies for so long. People like these movies, not just for giant monster fights, but because of the worlds that that are built on screen as the characters that exist in them, and relationships between them. There's always there's so much more than just monsters kicking the crap out of monsters. And I wanted to I wanted to have that be apparent in the game and So that's part of the reason that it hasn't ended story is that that's a big part of any good haiku franchises that they, you know, think someone put together some kind of chart that showed like the amount of screen time Godzilla has in every movie. And in some of them, it's as little as four minutes. I think the biggest it gets is like 15 or 20 minutes. And really, at least 90 minutes long, right? So like, one of the longest running movie franchises ever. And they're not just releasing, you know, monster fight compilations into theaters, people are watching them for way more than that. Yeah. So I wanted to do that. But I also wanted to respect from an action game perspective, it can be kind of jarring when you're like, Man, I'm having so much fun fighting. And then you have to like sit through minutes and minutes and minutes. cutscenes. So we wanted to have an element of the story that players could really invest in themselves and interact with. So that's where the archives, if you're interested in learning about the lore and history of this world, all in there, and you're rewarded. If you dig into every archive file, there's stuff you're going to see in the game and in the dialogues, all sorts of stuff that you'll be like, Oh, I know what that means. Or I know what that is, or I understand something about that someone else might. Because we think that that kind of gives it a little bit of an interactive gamey element, you can't really get that out of other forms. Yeah. Yeah, no, that was that was the the idea.

Jonas Rosland  31:36  
I really like digging into it. Because it's not just a like a monster Compendium, either. You have that, of course. So you can dig into the other monsters that you fight. But you also have a ton of lore about all the other stuff as well, the energy source shield energy, and kind of explaining what they think it is and how they think it works. And, yeah, I think it adds a lot. And I really liked that you made that conscious decision of not forcing it upon the player, but people who wanted to dig into the lore can do so at their own time.

Alex Rushdy  32:18  
Yeah, well, and it's funny, because we also want it to feel like there's more to the game world in what you experienced in the game. And so the, the writer for the game, they had dinner of directors names, and I, he had initially written I think we had double or more than double what's actually apparent in the archives. So he, he constructed this whole history of this world. So even though you don't get all of it in the game, you can tell that there's links and hints to other things that are happening. We even we did release a little it was a kind of tie in promotional comic, gives a little bit of a prelude to the game. Because we always felt that it, we wanted to make something rich enough that we could potentially expand it into all sorts of other media.

Jonas Rosland  33:20  
One thing that I found, let me see if I can pull that up here. These images here, where you actually have like the anatomy of mega Don, who's the first character that you that you control. And just seeing this and seeing this in such detail. I just love that. So I'm a big fan of old black and white horror movies and monster movies as well. So just seeing something like this, immediately caught my eye. I'm like, this is someone who definitely loves these movies and loves the genre. So this was really, really cool to see. I believe we also have one for Tempus Galahad. The robot kaiju do you call them cages if the robots

Alex Rushdy  34:13  
that's like a philosophical debate? I I, I just call it a robot or a mecca.

Jonas Rosland  34:23  
Mecca might be a better, better term for it. Yeah. So these are two of the characters that you can play us and so far, I've experienced four characters. Is there more characters that you can play us throughout the game? Maybe that's spoilers.

Alex Rushdy  34:42  
Well, it's not not yet. There's only the four in the base game, but there is a DLC expansion coming out next year. And that's going to include the fifth playable character, which is very much inspired by the Power Rangers Megazord. So Ooh, Ooh, interesting. Yeah, we're pretty, pretty excited to we held a poll so that our fans could choose who they wanted to be the next playable character, and this character one by by a lot. So I'm, I've been playing around with it like, you know in in this prototype version that I've been working on and they're really fun to play so excited to release that.

Jonas Rosland  35:23  
Oh, that's awesome what are some of the when you looked into the fighting mechanics of the game here? What were some of the things that you what were some of the hurdles that you hit a in some things that you overcame, and eventually made the game better? Well if you had any

Alex Rushdy  35:53  
now we definitely did. It's, you know, it's, it's it was interesting. When we first started going to the monsters we started it a long time ago, and it wasn't done a series it was started in 2016, we created a prototype, and it was a fighting game. And it was actually a no if you know, the, the old NeoGeo game King of the Monsters. Yep. But it was supposed to be a King of the Monsters like three. Oh, come. And so we had built you know, move sets and all this stuff to create this fighting game prototype. And there are a lot of similarities between fighting games, a beat 'em ups, but there are a lot of key differences as well. So when we decided to turn into a beat him up, we wanted to carry over a lot of the depth, but we wanted to make it less complex so that players could just more easily hop in. But another thing we wanted to do that was really important to us. And was a pretty significant challenge in terms of like the amount of work it took was to make each character play significantly differently from the other. So we made a lot of early calls were like okay, mega Don is going to be our kind of more classic guy's going to be a brawler is going to be have really heavy hits. And then we were like, Okay, well Tempest for example, Tempest Galahad. We're like, she's going to use a gun, she's going to be arranged to beat him up character, which is not very common. Even in the 3d Beat him up.

Jonas Rosland  37:26  
I had a lot of fun playing with Tempest, by the way, that I'm

Alex Rushdy  37:29  
glad it was, it was a challenge to get here to work in a way that it felt natural, but unique. Right. And I think that was a big challenge for a lot of the characters was to balance that. Tempest is probably the most complicated character to play. But once you once you click with there, you're like, Wow, this is pretty unique. In terms of this type of game, can you euro as well with Can you or we were like, well, we want a character that can summon another character, you know, that can use another character as part of their kit. And that was something that we were able to achieve and then with with a just prime, we were like, We want something that's really fast and kind of targeting those Devil May Cry for really quick combos, and a lot of more technical, speedy scale and stuff like that. And like one of his moves is just just canceled his animation and gives him a speed buff so that you can just immediately convert it to something else. So yeah, I think the main challenge was making sure that the characters all felt very unique from each other. But in the same breath, if you're playing with a friend, none of them should be so complicated that you can't just have mash

Jonas Rosland  38:49  
Yeah, they they're definitely different enough in the play style is very different for each of them, and it feels right. I definitely think that you hit hit the mark on all of them, because they're really fun to play. They have vastly different play styles, but it's really fun just to mix it up. So I've been trying out all of them. And Tempest is definitely one of my favorite ages super fast thing. I mean Megatron is make it up. So it's super cool brawler strong super fun. Yeah. And gear is just really cool as well. And the was the shield bubble mechanic and yeah, it's just a lot of fun to play and to try them out. Instead of being stuck with just essentially skins of of different different characters, but they're, they're essentially the same. So this is really cool to just have four very different characters with very different playstyles I really Enjoy it.

Alex Rushdy  40:01  
Thank you. Yeah.

Jonas Rosland  40:03  
So what are you? What are you looking for? When it comes to the future of Dawn of the Monsters? You said there's a DLC coming out next year? Yeah. Can you tell us a bit more about that? Or is that under under NDA still?

Alex Rushdy  40:23  
I can tell you that I can tell you that. All right. So the DLC, we're hoping to launch it. Like early next year, quarter one, quarter two, if all goes well. And it's going to be a mix of there's going to be some free content. I think nowadays people call that a title update. Which is a weird word to me. But sure, we'll call it that free DLC, we're giving some free DLC. And then we're also giving some paid DLC, which will include the new playable character named meaty, or Temujin, which is a giant Megazord character. And, and some other content included in that paid DLC, like a brand new game mode. So I can't speak to the specifics of the all the new content. But I will say that I guess one of the main pieces of feedback that we got from our players was this game is really fun, we're really enjoying it, we wish that there was more like they're like, we just want to keep playing it. And, you know, have more content too. So that's what we're trying to address is give way more content in a way that people can just keep playing it trying new builds, new ideas, characters. So there's that that's that we're really excited about, I think it's going to be really good. And I think it's going to make the whole package like really strong. But there's also something else that we're really excited about is that in early next year, timing, I'm not 100% Sure. We're going to be releasing the game in Japan. So it hasn't been released in Japan yet. Cool. And we're very excited about releasing it there. Because, I mean, it's made with a lot of love for Japanese movie monsters. And in addition to releasing it there, it's going to get its own physical version that people can import if they want because it had a physical version through limited run here, that that's obviously sold out. So people missed out they can grab it. And not only will it have all the English language, or you know, all the language options from the original it adds Japanese voice act. So for those who really liked their Japanese monster movies, you could play it in Japanese voice with English subtitles. I love that that applies. Yeah, I'm really excited about that. And we'll be we'll be adding that as a free update to all versions.

Jonas Rosland  42:56  
Oh, that's awesome. That's awesome, because that's definitely my favorite way to play games from Japan, or games published in Japan. If they have Japanese voice acting and English subtitles, that's always my go to so that's awesome to hear.

Alex Rushdy  43:11  
Yeah, I'm pretty excited, right? It's how I it's one thing I really love about the Yakuza games, because they're not called that anymore, but like, playing them in Japanese with English subs just feels right. Just as

Jonas Rosland  43:23  
Yeah, I'm actually playing Yakuza Kiwami to now in December because it's a it's a Christmas game. So holiday game.

Alex Rushdy  43:32  
I it is I didn't even think of it that way. But you're absolutely right. Yeah, they're

Jonas Rosland  43:36  
all they're all set in December. And they all have like Christmas trees and stores and things like that. So we're doing a little game challenge in the hit Save! Discord, so we're focused on holiday or Winter Games, so I chose that awesome that's so that's really cool. What was the what was the reception like for the physical version that you released with limited run games?

Alex Rushdy  44:06  
It was great. I mean, it people surprisingly at launch have to double check but I feel like the physical outsold the digital by like a factor of like four times. Wow. Yeah, people really wanted to I mean, it's it's a great package like the team a limited run. Made a like the standard physical is awesome. It's got a full color manual and stuff. But the collector's edition has amazing box art that makes it look like a giant old VHS box. Got collectible toys in it got a whole bunch of really cool stuff. And that one hasn't shipped out yet, but I can't wait until it arrives and any of that includes those those anatomical drawings as like posters and like, pick them up on my wall.

Jonas Rosland  44:58  
Yeah, I'm looking Get the information from limited run games here. And it seems like I missed ordering that one. So I'll have to pick up the Japanese copy. This is really, really nice looking. This is really cool. Now the minifigure set and in the the Yeah, the anatomical drawings and everything. This is really cool.

Alex Rushdy  45:22  
Yeah, I think people maybe it's especially kaiju fans, I mean, they like having a physical memento of something. I mean, we have a another side gig that I do. It's a company called seismic toys. And we released see if I have one around here we released these like, giant soft vinyl toys of mega Don and Guinea era. Oh, cool. And, you know, we released Megalodon back in 2019. And like, these are like, you know, they're not I wouldn't really say they're toys. They're like collector's items right there. Yeah. And so like, this is like $125 or 130 bucks. And Megatron sold out pretty quickly, even though the game wasn't out for another like two years. You know? That's funny. So and right now we're doing a we've got a makeshift campaign. So that's like a, they make plushies. And basically, it's kind of like Kickstarter. If we meet a certain order, then they make a bunch of plushies of Megalodon. So we're doing that right now as well. And in August, we had a partnership with a ramen restaurant. All around Ontario, where we had a special Megalodon ramen that you could come in and get it was this massive, like, spicy, meaty ramen. And if you if you ordered one you could enter into like a sweepstakes and get a free comments. It was pretty cool.

Jonas Rosland  47:08  
Oh, that's awesome. That's hilarious. That's a really cool tie in.

Alex Rushdy  47:16  
I like these kind of, you know, weird ideas and different concepts. That to me, they they just they made sense with the idea with the brand of dynamite is like, what would a giant Japanese monster eat like a huge bowl of spicy rock?

Jonas Rosland  47:35  
That's awesome. That's awesome. So to kind of wrap things up around Dawn of the Monsters here, what what are you most focused on? And what are you most excited about for the future of Dawn of the Monsters and the DLC that's coming out in the community that's

Alex Rushdy  47:58  
gathering around this game. I mean, I know I can't talk much about it. But I'm really excited to see how people what people do with the new content we're giving them like the character is a big thing. The new character is really, really, like it's always interesting. As a developer, you can kind of get a little tunnel visioned. And think, you know, I'll go into the combo lab and be like, Yeah, I probably figured out every couple that there is and then some random person on Twitter will be like, Oh, check out this tempest Galahad combine to agnostic, I didn't even know that was possible. So media Temujin. So much potential for that funny stuff. And I think the new game modes, people will will really dig because they really are focused on being like, Hey, this is something you can come back to over and over and over again, experiment and try different things and post high scores. And so I'm just excited to for the community to get their hands on that stuff. And I'm really excited to see how the Japanese audience reacts to the game. And what they think. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Jonas Rosland  49:09  
When? When is it releasing in Japan? Do you know?

Alex Rushdy  49:14  
I'm not 100% sure yet. I think it's quarter, quarter one or quarter two. Pretty soon,

Jonas Rosland  49:23  
I'll be able to look out for sure. I import a bunch of things from from Japan. So this is definitely something that I want to grab.

Alex Rushdy  49:29  
Yeah, it's funny. It's already up for pre order on Amazon, Japan and play Asia and stuff. I was like, oh, there it is.

Jonas Rosland  49:36  
Even better. Even better. I'll do that. That's awesome. So my final question here is as an indie game developer and the CEO of an indie game studio. What are you most excited about? For the indie game scene in the indie game community going forward? Word

Alex Rushdy  50:02  
huh? That's a tricky question. Question. Um, I think what's exciting to me, you know, in terms of where Indie games are going is seeing

like, the more that big companies are heading into purely games as a service, purely online multiplayer stuff, I'm excited to see in these pickup the slack where AAA is not interested anymore.

You know, nostalgia is shifting away from the 80s into the 90s and the 2000s I think that we'll see indies taking on more games and res than expected and hopefully see see a lot more indie teams grow into that like single a and double A space. Because I feel like the most exciting ideas and games for me right now are coming from small team. And if those small teams can get the budgets to make like, bigger 3d games and feel like they'll just be really, really exciting and really fun and kind of remind me of why I love video games. I love that.

Jonas Rosland  51:27  
I love that. I couldn't agree more with you. I think what I'm what we're seeing from indies coming out from Indies is just amazing. They're they're so vastly different. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. So last thing here. How can people find you online? 13AM games online, Dawn of the Monsters online, where where can we find you.
