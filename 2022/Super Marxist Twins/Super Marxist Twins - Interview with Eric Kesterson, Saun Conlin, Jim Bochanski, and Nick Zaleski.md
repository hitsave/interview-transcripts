Jonas Rosland  0:22  
Hi everyone, and welcome to yet another Indie Game Preservation Initiative. Interview here with some fine folks from type three studios. We got Eric, Saun, Jim and Nick here with us. Why don't you all introduce yourselves?

Nick Zaleski  0:44  
First, Eric,

Eric Kesterson  0:45  
I'm Eric, the programmer and sort of generalist, the guy who glues everything together. And yeah, happy to be here. So Thanks for Thanks for inviting us.

Saun Conlin  1:02  
I guess we'll go down the list of screens. That too. Yeah. I'm Saun Conlin. You know, I've done a little bit of the audio work. I've worked at the Games Marketing, keep it a little bit of a, you know, keeping us legal, like, accounting playtesting. And, you know, just, you know, I did some work to kind of get us into the backspace.

Jonas Rosland  1:32  
That's awesome. Awesome.

Jim Bochanski  1:35  
Hi, Jimbo Chatzky, all of the character animations, some of the game mechanics like just how enemies operate, and some of the level designs, but not most of either.

Jonas Rosland  1:47  
Awesome.

Nick Zaleski  1:50  
I'm Nick, and I guess I would be, I guess, the lead designer or creator, I just came up with the idea for the game, Eric told me to come up with an idea for a game that something he thought that, you know, a small team could work on. And I thought, you know, side scrolling platformer would be good. Seems like something a small team could do. And I also do the level editing, most of it.

Jonas Rosland  2:20  
Fantastic. So we're here today to talk about a really fun game that I found out about at PAX East, Super Marxist Twins. And, of course, the the character design the name and everything really grabbed me first. And I definitely want to dig into the legal aspect with you, Saun about this later. But it's a really, really fun game I played through the demo last week, and it's just super, super fun. But before we dive into the game itself, I would love to hear about how you all got to where you are right now. I was talking to I was talking to Eric a bit over email before and how this is a passion project and something that you do when you have time when you have some free time. So tell me how you how you started this and how you got to where you are.

Eric Kesterson  3:24  
Kick it off. We've basically just been friends for a long time and are all into video games and all like, like the idea of trying to create things. So a ways back, Nick and I worked on, you know, some half life two mods, or a half life two mod. Yeah, we were kind of into that. You know, seeing there's like a few few community forums and stuff going on then. And while we had like a pretty cool project going, we had like a really cool intro. There was like, technical challenges to getting things just right. And we were probably being like, maybe, like, I might have been being too perfectionist about things like, I couldn't kind of get past like some of the little hiccups, where you know, you've got your nice, brilliant scene playing out and then like a character spins around in a weird way before they walk away or something like that, you know, it's like that stuff always bothers you because it looks wrong. But anyway, I think, you know, that's partly why as Nick as Nick mentioned, like we kind of decided like, what's something that is going to be maybe a little bit more a little bit easier for like a team our size to execute? And as you mentioned, like, this is in our free time because we've all got day jobs. So You know, we're not like spending, you know, eight hours, 40 hours a week, you know, doing this. So yeah, I mean, that's, that's pretty much like, like how I personally got to where I am is, I've wanted to wanted to make games since I was a kid. And in college figured out, like, by way of a logic course, that I could probably do programming. So I changed my major and got a degree doing that and had been a software developer since then. But basically, all entirely knowing that like, well, programming is part of games. And I want to make games so I went that way.

Jonas Rosland  5:48  
Awesome. Yeah, I wanted to get into game programming, when I started at the university, but I didn't get into that program. So I joined regular programming instead and went down that route. And I never recovered, unfortunately.

Eric Kesterson  6:05  
Yeah, there weren't there weren't that many game I was looking for, like one of those, like, you know, game design programs, and there weren't that many at the time that I was, you know, going into college. So I went to programming, like, just knowing that was part of it. And, you know, figuring out I could probably do it, and knowing like, I could probably support myself, you know, as a as a backup if I wasn't able to immediately make money, you know, making games in my spare time. So, yeah.

Saun Conlin  6:44  
John, Eric, and I go back to about fifth grade, across the street. Nick, and I go back to about high school when Eric and I met Eric and I met Dick in freshman year. And then Jimbo and I go back. You know,

Jim Bochanski  7:04  
Blockbuster video

Saun Conlin  7:05  
Blockbuster video, Jimbo worked with me at Blockbuster video.

Jim Bochanski  7:08  
Kinda dates us a little bit

Saun Conlin  7:10  
In high school. And you know, Jimbo, also, you know, he became friends with a little bit later in life after after the blockbuster days, so

Jim Bochanski  7:20  
long after VHS like right before blu ray, I would say,

Saun Conlin  7:26  
yes. I actually have a background in accounting. And a little bit of a background in music. Eric and I both have a background in music. We Eric played bass. I played the drums. So, you know, we were like, uh, you know, I guess garage music musicians for a little while as well. Eric's garage, you know, is actually it's been

Eric Kesterson  7:53  
a headless rhythm section.

Saun Conlin  7:57  
Exactly. Yeah. So. And join us. I think, you know, prior to this interview, you mentioned that you were six years old when you started playing video games. I was I was around that age, but probably six or seven. I remember running around the house, you know, screaming my head off with an NES, like holding it up on Christmas. Yeah, you know, I've been a lifeline long gamer as well. And I think, you know, when, when, you know, the first time I saw it was actually, you know, Nick and Eric, were working on that HalfLife mod, and it's called the battlefield Philadelphia or battle Philadelphia. And, you know, I, I was actually pretty impressed with, you know, their skills, because, you know, first of all, like, the attention to detail, like they were walking around filets snapping photos of buildings, and kind of incorporating this into like, a futuristic setting. And, you know, I was really impressed with Nick, he was doing a lot of work where he was just like, manipulating the face to animate to talk, you know, and it was really cool. Just watching him doing I was like, you know, I was like, it gave me it gave me a little inspiration that maybe these guys can can do it. So, you know, when, when they started talking about, you know, this concept of super Marxist twin so, you know, I really thought about it was like, you know, we could probably make this happen, you know, and I mean, when I say we, it's very strongly like, you know, Nick, Eric, Jimbo has got the Jimbo has got the art skills are more or less like, you know, filling in some of the cracks or the gaps there. But, you know, like, when I say keeping us legal part of our my work was to also kind of like incorporate type three studios and you know, just do our do our the nitty gritty filings with the states and whatnot. So, you know, putting a little of that accounting background, the skills well, or you know, the skills to work.

Eric Kesterson  9:58  
Make it so we're alive. they actually sell things at PAX when we go there.

Jonas Rosland  10:04  
That's always good. That's always good. Yeah, having someone to help with paperwork is very helpful.

All right, so

Jim Bochanski  10:16  
I've loved video games, since I got a Super Nintendo. For Christmas, it was like probably 1991, because that's where it came out. And I got Legend of Zelda Link to the Past. And then ever since I played that, video games and their imagery, imagery have always been in my imagination. And there would even be instances when I would be like at family picnics and stuff. And I was the oldest, like one of the older cousins. And usually I'd have a lot of my younger cousins would hang out. And I would like, throw soccer balls and footballs at them. And I'd give them rules and like make them play like real life, human Pong, or like, asteroids. And like the idea of gaming and engaging people has just been like, in my blood since I played that game. And when I was in the blockbuster days that Sean referenced earlier, there was this guy that worked at Blockbuster. And he introduced me to a program called Games Factory. And that program, it's like this French software that you can use to just like, like DIY, glue game pieces together, like you can give things speeds and lives and different art. It's got like a pixel animation element inside of it. And so I did that when I was about like, maybe 14 or 15. And I've also always drawn my whole life. So when it was time to go to college, I went to SVA, I learned how to illustrate. Then I went to I didn't graduate there, I actually went to full sail and learn how to do computer animation, which I've done some work with over the years. But I've actually just had like normal day jobs a lot of the time cuz I would spend most of my spare time working on my own game dev projects. And I was just kind of like wandering, you know, for years, man. I was like some guy who crashed his plane in the desert, and I'm just wandering by myself and this game dev world, because I'll tell you what, man, you work on games. It takes everything to pull it off. And the reason why I say crashed a plane in the desert is because I was about done until I met these guys. The guys up there and the guy down there. I met them. And I basically didn't stop working on games because of that. And I feel like I brought something to them. And they also brought a lot to me. I feel like that sums it up. Yeah.

Saun Conlin  12:36  
Before you mentioned a plane crashing in the desert, I kind of the words Hexcel Ronin came to mind. I'll take it. Got it.

Jonas Rosland  12:54  
That's wonderful. I love it. I love it.

Nick Zaleski  13:00  
Well, I was a communications and film major in college. And I've always I've always been into video games for a long time. In particular, I've been a PC gamer since pretty hardcore PC gamers since I think it was 1994 My dad got us a amazing 99 megahertz Pentium 486 with like, I think a whopping like 16 megabytes of RAM, something like that. But I've been into gaming ever since then. And I wanted to make movies when I went into college and I started going back and play half life two was coming out, I went back and I started playing the original Half Life. And I remember just being amazed at the scripted sequences and how video video games are kind of becoming their own medium. Like, you know, normally when you see when would stories told through cutscenes that's not really using video games to tell a story that's incorporating film into a video game to help tell the story but I was really blown away with how Valve you know, told a story with video games. And towards the end of college I realized, you know, maybe I want to use my, you know, film storytelling skills in a video game maybe. Because, you know, I don't have any background in game design. But I you know, I played so many games and I felt like I had a good enough understanding of the medium that maybe it's something that I could do so meet Eric, we worked on our half life mod after college for years and years. And it was fun and everything but it wasn't it wasn't something that we could really see a career like, you know, coming out of and then Eric just had this idea What if we do something smaller that you know, at the time it was just me and him and he said you know, let's let's do that. Let's come up with something that the two of us can do and maybe we'll get Some other friends in on it and make like a group project out of it and so I've just been working on Super Marxist twins with these guys since then and teaching up teaching substitute teaching in the meantime as a day job

Jonas Rosland  15:19  
awesome awesome. We want to dive into the game but for everyone watching and listening here we'll we'll play the trailer for supermax his twins before we dive into the game.

So that was the

the trailer for Super Marxist twins. I love how you incorporated all the old music, old Soviet music here and the imagery and everything. What really pulled me in when I saw you all at PAX was of course the the characters. As I mentioned before, I was like, I recognize something here. And then I saw the name. I was like, I recognize something here too. So tell us how did how did you start with this specific game? The Super Marxist Twinsen? How did it evolve into what it is right now?

Nick Zaleski  17:53  
Well, Eric told me that I had to come up with something that a small team could work on. And I thought sidescroller but you know, side scrollers are kind of like a dime a dozen. And I thought we had to do something to make ours kind of stand out something that would hook people in and I thought, you know, maybe if we added, you know, this wacky Soviet propaganda to it, then maybe we'd have something, you know, really unique that would grab people's attention. And that was kind of it.

Jonas Rosland  18:23  
Did you did you ever feel like you might get hunted down by Nintendo for doing this? Well,

Nick Zaleski  18:31  
that since the beginning. I mean, I did. I didn't do a whole lot of stuff with like copyright law. And actually, I didn't really I mean, we only touched on copyright law a little bit when I was in college, but they, I remember one thing they talked about is that parody is protected by copyright law. And I always kind of knew we're not making a carbon copy of Mario Brothers.

Jonas Rosland  18:59  
Oh, that's referring to Okay. Yeah.

Jim Bochanski  19:04  
You know, what, say something about brothers. I don't know what you guys are talking about.

Nick Zaleski  19:10  
But it is very intentionally meant to parody and kind of like, be somewhat reminiscent of that game, but it's very much its own thing.

Jim Bochanski  19:22  
I would say in a lot of ways it borrows from lots of different games from that era. Like, yeah, there's some eight and 16 did.

Nick Zaleski  19:31  
Yeah, there's some Sonic the Hedgehog in Donkey Kong Country influences in there, too. Oh, yeah.

Saun Conlin  19:39  
Yeah. And it was actually, you know, one of the things Eric was making for the game back when we started writing the design doc for it and all was, you know, Eric was a kind of making a tool for Nick to do a little bit of a level design, right. It was a level editor. Well, level level editors are No unique, we've seen them in like RPG editors for games and stuff like that, you know, like dev games based on that, you know, at the time when we started working on it, you know, it was kind of interesting to be able to kind of release, you know, a platforming game, where, where there would be a level editor, there'll be and we were talking about, you know, putting a community to, like attaching the community aspect to it, and allowing people to share and, you know, the levels and cetera. And then, of course, another game recently came out that we're like, we're, you know, we're kind of face falling when that happened. But, you know, at the same time, you know, I think from all from legal aspect, we were kind of saying, Okay, well, you know, one week, we have this in our design doc, which came out well, before, you know, a certain maker was announced. So, you know, from that perspective, you know, just just kind of see why, like, making a design doc is almost a way to cover your own butt, you know, see why OA because, you know, with a design doc, you have a time stamp on on when you wrote it, what you wanted to make out of the game. And, you know, it does in my mind, you know, it doesn't kind of matter, you know, what's what's been released, as long as you're not blatantly, you know, stealing property or, or claiming that trying to, like, one make your property merged with that of another property. Right. So, what we are trying to do is make our own universe, you know, make our own game. And we're not trying to, you know, essentially staple our game to any other game, you know.

Jonas Rosland  21:50  
Yeah, I had a blast playing through it. And I really think you're, you're doing a fantastic job building up the, your own world and your own universe here. I always say, Thanks, man. Ya know, as I was playing it, I was like, this is super fun. And I was reading through parts of the, the design doc as well. And I was like, yes, you're absolutely right, that it's, it's a parody, of course of Super Mario Brothers and others. And it's also one where you were the difficulty increases pretty rapidly, I would say, the, as I was playing the demo, I was like, I'm dying all the time here. But it's because I hadn't learned the mechanics yet. And as I was learning the mechanics, I was like, this is super fun. And it was super so fluid when I played through the levels after playing through them a few times, I was like, Hey, this is really fun. And I can definitely see people speed running this later. And because I think it was, the last level gets pretty chaotic. I am in the demo the last level in demo, but gets pretty chaotic. And I had a blast just avoiding everything and trying to run as fast as I could. And I'll be doing this live on stream as well. I'll be playing the demo because I love platformers platformers is my favorite genre hands down and I had so much fun playing this and i i I really love that the characters here Mikhail and Luke mele just super super fun and the the enemies as well and we'll go into those too. But yeah, I think you're doing a fantastic job just building out your own your own story here. Before I talk about the story, who wants to talk about the story of super Marxist twins why are we playing this game? Nick

Nick Zaleski  23:49  
well the story is meant to be kind of I don't want to say I mean there's not a lot to it it's basically just you know, this evils are boar off has taken over this country and seized all the resources from the people and you know the people and quotations and now the Marxist twins have to get it back and free the country pretty simple straightforward to the point I think it's better than you know you have to rescue some Princess out of a castle it's not that shallow

Jonas Rosland  24:26  
so if we go into the protagonist here we got the the two characters Mikhail or Mikhail or Mikhail I'm not really sure how to pronounce it. Maybe someone on the internet can correct me. And look,

Nick Zaleski  24:43  
it's all interchangeable.

Jonas Rosland  24:46  
How did you get to these names and these characters and and also their their powers? I would love to dive into those.

Nick Zaleski  24:57  
Well, since it's a Mario parody We want it I wanted to make, you know, an m&a team and a L name instead of Mario and Luigi and they'd be you know Russian instead of Italian. I came up with mkhaya We kind of went back and forth on the Kyle that was originally it and then we switched to me Lor and then we switch back to Mikhail, I just thought Mikhail was a good name because it's obviously Russian kind of like how Mario is obviously Italian. And then we we didn't know what to come up with for the next for the L name. So we just went through a list of like, different Russian names and picked out woodmill because it sounded funny.

Eric Kesterson  25:46  
I'm not sure if it still says it in the design doc, I think it for one very brief time Liudmyla was like Leone or something like that. Which I can't remember it might still be in the design doc, but he changed quickly and then stayed Leadmill for basically

Jonas Rosland  26:04  
you know, just about the whole development.

Saun Conlin  26:09  
And Eric and I've been calling McHale, Mahler pretty much up until Pax. So we've kind of had to train ourselves not to before Pax.

Nick Zaleski  26:19  
Yeah, they say it and I like don't even notice it, because it's just become so interchangeable.

Jonas Rosland  26:27  
And they have their powers as well. Hammer and sickle.

Nick Zaleski  26:32  
Yes. Yeah, coming up with an idea for power ups was really tough. I think I had like work gloves in the original design document and work boots and like a whole bunch of other stuff that just didn't work out. Right. And then one night, I just was laying in bed stone and I just had this idea for hammer and sickle as weapons.

Jonas Rosland  26:56  
I love it. I love it. And I think it works really well. The with the hammer breaking stones, with the sickle breaking the these hay bales and things like that it works really well. And possibility of aiming as well. A bit better than in other Mario games, of course, many other platforms, just being able to aim where your projectiles go was very useful.

Jim Bochanski  27:25  
Originally have that. And Eric added it in during development. And when he did, I was like, dude, Mario doesn't do that. What are you talking about? And actually just went up being like, like you said, it's like a great feature. It gives the gameplay depth.

Jonas Rosland  27:39  
Yeah, for sure.

Jim Bochanski  27:41  
I think one of the one of the really, I want to say like, great qualities of our project, like little East in the development side, is our leader is constantly improvising new stuff, like he through Co Op, right before Pax and I was like, Dude, that feature is too big. It's risky. He did it. And it was like the hit in terms of all the all the elements of our paradigm. So we had a little

Saun Conlin  28:11  
bit of a line going up for the co op it was very ballsy move, because, like, yeah, it was very untested. And we're just like, yes, it's also good to PAX, why not?

Eric Kesterson  28:24  
It was in a pretty buggy state too. But luckily, like when, because we did like a thing that contained the demo to you know, not messing around a whole lot on in the menus and stuff. You're just kind of playing through. It sort of mashed it up some and like it was not full featured. It's still we're actually still working on some of the co op stuff, getting it all ironed out. But But yeah, the core of it was there. And that's really it was really like, the important part was like, alright, is it is this fun? And like Nick and I like tried it in like, I think our hotel room when we got there and we're like, yeah, yeah, it's fun. Let's let's just bring an extra controller and we'll we'll show it to people. Yeah.

Jonas Rosland  29:10  
Wait at the hotel room. Heading into packs.

Jim Bochanski  29:15  
Dude, last minute, man.

Jonas Rosland  29:18  
It's amazing.

Jim Bochanski  29:22  
Yeah, that's that's probably I feel like that's like the spirit, their team and bodies would be awesome.

Eric Kesterson  29:30  
Anti professional, just like, I don't know, let's let's try this. Let's do, let's do that.

Nick Zaleski  29:37  
There was a point in development where we had brought up to the possibility of co op and I kind of shot it down. Because I thought it was I was really worried in when we first started developing the game that if it didn't look and play enough like Mario, then people wouldn't get the parody aspect of it at some point. I just said, You know what, fuck it. Let's start making I think people get the parody in the name just fine. So let's just do our own thing and have at it.

Eric Kesterson  30:09  
Yeah. And I mean, I had, like, wanted to try to do coop for a long time. I just kept like, kind of backburner, ring it. And then we did another convention two weeks before PAX, and so many people asked, Is this no up? Because there's two characters that are just like, man, like, every time somebody asks that, and we got to say, full No, but like, maybe it will be someday, but it's not right now. It's just like a total. Like, I'd rather eat a shoe every time I had to say that. And, and like, I was just like, you know, going to PAX, like, people are expecting this enough that I gotta at least give it a shot and see, like, and if it's, if it doesn't work out, I'd rather I'd also rather be able to just flat say, No, it's not then then to be like, well, we want to try that. But I don't know. You know, so it was like, We gotta give this a shot and see, and, and I knew that if we were going to do it, I wanted to be able to say like, yes to it by the time we got to PAX, because that other show we did was like a microcosm, it was like, it was like, a was like training for you know, PAX, which was just an insane number of people to the sea of people. And I'm, like, like, branching out into topics here. But But yeah, it's like, we, we use that to get ready. And, and we used, I use that to decide like, Yeah, I'm going to try to do put coop in. And then I had concerns also, like, we're developing like, the single player game, it just happens to have two characters. Is it really balanced if you start playing with a second person and actually, like, that's sort of another aspect of like, you know, I guess I can't say genius, because it wasn't intentional. But it was, but luck that Nick had that idea about, you know, the hammers and sickles and the bricks, and hey, because each, you know, each character is unique, and they're not able to do everything themselves. So it's not like you get to contract guys instead of one, you know, and you can just kind of blast your way through it. I mean, not that Contra was even unbalanced and Co Op, but I'm just saying like, it's not like they're, they're that interchangeable. You know, they, they do different things. So

Jim Bochanski  32:36  
they're asymmetrical. And not only does each weapon break a different block type, but they also have different trajectories. So tactically, each one has advantages in different situations. It's really dynamic, like Nick's entire, like set of features with the hammer and the sickle, I would say it's the core of what makes this game unique. And it's, it makes it like this kind of hybrid between, like MegaMan, and, and your standard Mario platformer. It's really neither one of those, it's both, because like, you play MegaMan, you gotta like, pick a different weapon for a different boss, you know, and with Marxist twins, you've got to pick one of the tools of the people to take down the the oppressive overlords or whatever, yeah, I know, Nick made it up. So he could tell you what it is.

Saun Conlin  33:30  
Yeah, we did jimbros point, the, you know, the topic of the trajectory of the weapons, I think it kind of like makes people you know, cooperate a little bit more, like, for example, you have the, you know, you've got to get through certain puzzle, like pieces of like, you know, hey, we want to unlock this thing. It's like, well, one person might, you know, start sprinting off screen, you know, but you kind of have to, like work together to kind of tackle some of these challenges. And, you know, and also the whole sprinting off the screen, you know, like I, I, when we first started doing the split screen, or that split screen, the two player I was like, Eric, should we you know, toyed with the notion of split screen should we kind of like split it up or join it back together when you know, they're on the same screen together something like that. And I think you know, you know, where we kind of landed on that right now is one is I think just having one person in control the camera at a time says okay, you know what, you kind of have to work together you're both gonna get it get a you know, bite a bullet, you know, so

Jonas Rosland  34:42  
yeah, no, I think it works really well. Even as a single player because I was playing it by myself here. And it works really well with the the switching of the characters and making sure that you use the right tool whenever you need to as well. It makes it honest

Jim Bochanski  35:00  
Yeah, sorry, I got a question for you. Did you notice that you can hit? I'm talking PlayStation controller here? I'm sorry, forget Xbox. But if you hit the circle button, your character whistles, and the other character throws the projectile. I noticed that. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Jonas Rosland  35:17  
All right. Same on both controllers to

O. Box.

I was like, Wait, why is he whistling? And then like a second later a projectile comes around. I was like, Wait, what just happened? Yeah. So yeah, I saw that. And I thought that was really cool. But I really like switching up the other characters as well. Because yeah, totally. Yeah, just having that that option is super neat. And having the both characters even when you're playing as a single player, you have both characters available to you, is really, I love that and just having to the second character jumping off, over after you and catching up with you. And yeah, just super, super fun. So, I know he is we talked about it, here. So let's dive into Pax a bit more. So you went to PAX, what was the reception like, at PAX?

Saun Conlin  36:23  
I would say Pax was I think we, we knew we had something going on for us. But like, we were just also kind of like, at one point I like I expected like, you know, a bunch of lawyers with briefcases from Nintendo just be like, shut it down. Like, you know, like, so that was kind of one of the, one of the worries I had, but it was very unfounded. What you know, and then I would also say, the other the other thing was that, you know, it, despite despite, you know, COVID and whatnot, and everybody like having a mask requirement, like I would say it was it was very packed. And I you know, we did spend, like, We're a small team. So every dollar we spent was pretty, pretty considerable for us. But at the same time, I feel like, you know, I can say for the team, we all felt pretty vindicated. When we went there, you know, just there was a lot like, there was very little vacancies in the seats. You know, to try the game. We had generated a lot of interest in, you know, I would say that the very first day, when they opened the doors, and you just see the crowds rushing by you to go sign up for something that, you know, isn't your game, you're like, man, what did we do? Like, what have we done? This is gonna be a slow PAX, and then all of a sudden, you know, people just started filtering in it was like, oh, okay, all right. Yeah, we've got we've got something here, you know. So that was that was my impression of PACs.

Jonas Rosland  38:02  
That must have been an amazing feeling. Yeah.

Oh, Eric. Nick, you guys want to jump in there? Go ahead, Nick.

Nick Zaleski  38:13  
Yeah, I was I was just worried that people weren't gonna get the parity aspect. But it seems like I just saw all these people. They'd walked by, they'd stop, they'd read the names sometimes out loud, they'd see super Marxist winds. And they'd stop for a second and then they just start cracking up and it's like, all right, I think they I think they get it. So I was that made me really that, like, killed a lot of my fears about the game.

Eric Kesterson  38:39  
Yeah, it the number of double takes and stuff was was like, awesome. Like, you know, some people, some people see the thing and they just get it, like, immediately get it. Some people like Nick said, it, like takes a second. There were definitely like, you know, people here like, there's it's visual overload. They're walking around the show floor like that, but there were, you know, some people like, walk by and like, look at your booth. Like, like, did you actually see anything? Like they're like, just kind of taking it all in or whatever? And it's like, okay, you know, that's cool. Have fun, but, yeah, the number the number of like, there the amount of, you know, the volume, I guess, of, of people that we showed you was just incredible. And you know, nobody. I don't know that anybody would do this, but nobody was like, This is stupid. Or, you know, like, this is bad, and I hate it, or, you know, anything like that. It's like it was just 100% Positive except the I mean, there were. There was like a little bit of note, but

Nick Zaleski  39:56  
there was one person who walked by and they were like, super Marxist. as twins, yeah, okay, whatever. But at that point, I was like, I was so happy with the reaction that I was getting from everybody else. I just kind of rubbed it off like, Yeah, whatever. Fuck that guy.

Saun Conlin  40:13  
That guy's gonna listen to this broadcast. He'd be like, No, fuck you dick.

Jonas Rosland  40:21  
Yeah, but you you you had some really nice visuals to draw people in. And I think having the characters be be very visible and having the, the title of the game being very visible as well as what pulled me in. I was like, I liked this. This is This is funny. I like this. And then I saw it. It was a platform. I'm like, I'm sold. I'm sold. And then you had a demo out? I'm like, Yes, of course. I'll play the demo. So yeah, it's it's super, super cool. What was the what did you learn from PACs that you want to do differently next time? If anything?

Eric Kesterson  41:12  
Do we want to give Shawn like maybe two or three more days to work on the shirts next time? No. No, yeah, yeah, you go ahead.

Saun Conlin  41:23  
Because that way, if you gave me two or three more days of work on the shirts, those shirts would have been done two or three more days. Laters. Some of it, some of it was a logo was procrastination, but it was more or less like I would. Yeah, we we definitely turned my basement into something resembling that of a sweatshop. You know, there was the only the only semi forced labor was my girlfriend. The way she talks about it. She's like, ah, let's just put my life in a basement, you know? But, uh, yeah. So, a lot of the what you saw at PAX that was that was homegrown. I would say maybe next time, you know, it was it was definitely a lot of work. I mean, we we sprinted from, we were preparing for two shows, we did it, we did a show in Philly, you know, before that, before Pax. And that was more like a trial show. Because we had never done a convention before. You know, and, I mean, I got it back to battle, I did conventions with my father. Like, when I was a kid, my dad sold comic books and horror movies at shows cool. And I helped him run those those tables, I think that was my, like, only experienced, I could really draw on to, like, really helped me get into like, what, what should we do to prepare for PAX? But I, you know, like, I would say one of one of the things I did to prepare to, like, learn from from PAX was, you know, one, we did the show in Philly, we had some growing pains there. And then also, the other thing is, you know, I went to like, what, what seemed like a completely unrelated dog show, you know, in like, February or March or so. So when I just kind of like, you know, walked around with my cell phone, just taking notes and saying like, Okay, what's, what's drawing people in to, you know, these tables and what's not, you know, like, what works, what doesn't, and some of the things I saw that like, didn't really wasn't really conducive to getting people to come in and try your things is like, kind of like setting up that like, table, you know, like, right at the front. And it's like, alright, this is our, our boundary, don't cross it will come, you know, sit across from you and talk to you if you want, but that's kind of like, you know, so when we got these tables, I was like, how do we arrange these tables, you know, and put them in such a way that it's not a barrier, it's an invitation, you know, for people to come in and say, hey, you know, check out the game, you know, and how do we how do we draw people in instead of, you know, our layout, even from the start, like repelling people? So, look, wait, I would say, you know, what, we, what we did take away from the get from it is that, you know, you're, you can't solely rely on that, you know, one show experience to kind of like, you know, ride the wave of, of, you know, sales or wish lists. You know, I would say that's probably the biggest takeaway from it was like, you know, I wouldn't say we felt let down per se but we were more or less just like, Okay, we know we've got to do more to kind of, you know, make this game more visible. I would also say that, you know, we got a lot of people coming And and asking us and this goes to Eric, you know, like basically having to eat a DSW worth of shoes. You know, like, we, we had people coming in and just saying like, Oh, you know, are you guys on switch? Are you on, you know, Xbox? Do you have any plans to be on it knows that like, wherever some plans? Well, you know, we might might be doing it, you know, so that was, you know, we're definitely considering that but like we after coming away from, you know, PACs, we had to say, you know, look, we definitely have, we definitely have interests, a lot of people, you know, like, you see a crowd of, you know, 100 people, and 80 of them are turning their heads, at least at the game, and you know, 70 of them are stopping 50 of them are actually getting in line to play the game, you know, like,

Jim Bochanski  45:50  
you build it, they will come Yeah, exactly.

Saun Conlin  45:53  
Exactly. So, you know, for us, I think it's more or less like, Okay, we got to think about, you know, what are our next steps to increase the visibility of the game. And I think that's our biggest takeaway, you know, from from PAX.

Eric Kesterson  46:07  
Yeah, it was, it was a nice bump in all of whatever villas, visibility metrics and things that you can talk about, but it wasn't really like a momentum. After that, it was like a bump, and then it got to the other end of the bump. And then, like, you know, there's slightly more, there's like a different pace of regular traffic. Well, I can see like the steam page traffic and the wishlist and stuff. And there's like, a slightly higher pace of those than before, but not like an enormous momentum, or something, it's like it was a bump. And on the other end of it, like, you know, a few people per day more than it was before, which was also only a few people per day. So it might have doubled to like a few few people per day, you know, coming to the store and wishlist thing, or whatever it is, but But yeah, that's sort of like Sean said, it was like, you know, it proved to us that, like the boulder can roll, but the boulder stopped rolling. So now we got to figure out where we're rolling it next. And, yeah, but also, like, we're finishing it, and we're kind of like, taking the approach of because because we decided to do early access. Like it's there, where we are, hopefully ever proving that we actually can make the thing and that we will get it done. And so, you know, hopefully that just, like, filled slowly as it goes and ended. And we just like, you know, bring it home. But yeah, that was that was kind of, like, similar to Shawn, like, kind of same takeaway from PAX for me, like, not, not really, it didn't really become like a huge momentum builder. But the reaction was so positive amongst like, the visibility that we did get that it to me prove that prove the concept and proved it has legs, you know,

Jonas Rosland  48:15  
so, concepts definitely got legs.

Saun Conlin  48:19  
I would also just say, like, you know, just observing the rest of the team, like, you know, everybody, everybody just, you know, they, they definitely felt vindicated. They, you know, they felt like we, we had something and they, you know, I would say, you know, like, Nick, Nick doesn't seem like the kind of guy that beams but he was positively beaming at PAX, you know, he was i He was proud, and I was proud of all proud of you. But

Nick Zaleski  48:48  
Alex did a great job getting us in there.

Eric Kesterson  48:52  
Yeah, my joke earlier too, was not to imply that there was any kind of procrastination it was to imply that like, we we brutalized, Shawn by laying on him, like the manufacturer of all, all of everything for the show, which we also just, you know, bogarted his basement for it, and just filled it up with the stuff.

Jim Bochanski  49:19  
Yeah, boxes of merch. Yeah. So

Eric Kesterson  49:22  
the things to do differently next time. Was really for me, like, we probably don't want to put Shawn through that again. We probably want to just, if we're going to do the merch thing, just find another way just do like, you know,

Saun Conlin  49:36  
the I'm just gonna find it. I'm buying a Cricut machine on company dime next time. All right, so I'm gonna get myself a shirt press. And you know what, we'll do this?

Eric Kesterson  49:50  
Yeah, we hit that point of like, are we making a video game or are we a print shop? Yeah, there was like prints and paper cutting everywhere, Shawn when drunk on weird free ink programs from whatever HP, he was like, I'll print 60 copies and we're gonna cut three of them because just in case we need more, I'm just going to print them because I got like unlimited ink right now through this program.

Jim Bochanski  50:21  
He found a loophole. You found a thrifty loophole.

Saun Conlin  50:26  
Yeah, I'm normally a very green guy. I recycle. I do all that, you know. And now I'm like, oh, man, I'm slaying trees left and right. Printing but

Jonas Rosland  50:39  
free ink. I mean that you can become rich on that alone.

Jim Bochanski  50:46  
Why are we even engaged yet for let's just

Jonas Rosland  50:48  
do this do?

Eric Kesterson  50:49  
I think the thing is, it wasn't like free ink. I think it was like a low cost trial of the program. And we were like, well, we only need it for a trial period. Really, we like the one and done sort of deal here. So let's just

Saun Conlin  51:03  
give it away trade secrets. Give it away.

Eric Kesterson  51:08  
I don't think there's that many indie game devs that are also in the print shop business.

Jonas Rosland  51:14  
You never know. You never know. Yeah.

Eric Kesterson  51:17  
If it works for us there there will be but we haven't even established that yet. So

Saun Conlin  51:21  
it I would say that was also the big one my biggest concerns going in. And, you know, going into Pax was like, okay, one art, like, I think I was always saying, you know, it's better that we would be over prepared. And, you know, maybe we'll have some merch leftover to do a Kickstarter campaign or something like that, you know. And after the Philly show, like the Philly show, we went to was more of a it wasn't a game shows like a it was more about like comics in Star Trek and whatnot. And so after that, like people were like, it was it was interesting, because the gamers that stopped like Salah stay stopped. And they're like, why I didn't know a video game was gonna be here, you know, like, you know, like, what they blew their mind and don't like the devs were actually there too. So

Jim Bochanski  52:11  
I was at that one. I think my favorite was the philosophy professor who actually like had a dense discussion with Nick about Marxism. It was really funny. And I was like, like, I felt like I was like our exact like most precise demographic he literally made the game for exactly that guy is just funny. Okay, he was also like a Gen X or so like Mario Brothers is like as like his teen years so like Yeah, exactly his like study and exactly his like game generation it was just funny seeing all that overlap

Saun Conlin  52:46  
in my nightmare I think for like the reoccurring stress was you know, we made over 1000 pins magnets keychains you know, we made 100 shirts or under 50 shirts or so and and we made all this the swag and we're like, okay, you know, we didn't really sell a whole lot in Philly you know we're not really like moving a lot and you know, are we gonna be like haul on all this stuff back from PACs, you know? And I was like, I was like, Oh man, like we're doing all this work and it Aido but like, I was like alright, you know even even two weeks after that Philly you know that's what the PAC show was I was like even up until tax I was still doing more production I was like, I'd rather just you know be not be saying like oh man I wish we could get more you know marketing material or pins or swag in the hands of people you know to for people to remember our game when they walk you know walk out there that that turned it out also to be out on font founded worry, you know, we had we ended up getting rid of like we ended up either selling or, you know, through our promotional you know, program like you know, handing out you know, pin all our all our keychains all our magnets, all our pins. We sold like a vast like I would say, what was it like 77% or so of our shirts of Fanta, you know, so, yeah, it was awesome. Yeah.

Jonas Rosland  54:29  
That's just fantastic. I love seeing merch just flying off the tables. Yeah, that's awesome. I want to dive into a thing related to pack but we'll do that in a bit. So the packs seem to be very successful for you all. I'm super here is super happy to hear that you got that big bump and then you also even if it's just a few that's still a few more Were every day that wish list the game and that's, that's what counts. So that's, that's awesome to hear. I love that. There were so many fantastic games at PAX I, I tried to play or at least talk to the devs of most of them there. But there were just so many. And I was exhausted after day two, I was like I, I had a lot of fun, but I can't I can't talk to everyone there. It's it's a big conference. It's definitely a big conference and was the one of the first ones I've done since this whole pandemic started as well. So it was just super, super fun to walk around and talk to everyone and I'm an extrovert and I was not able to network for for like a few hours. Going into the conference was super, super weird. And then after a while I got into it. I was like, Okay, now now I can do this. And that's when I talk to you all. So yeah, super, super cool. I want to dig into the game a bit more, and how you built out the game. We've been seeing that the protagonist here, McHale and and love mill. And I want to dig into the enemies a bit. So we've got these here, these capitalist pigs as as they are called. So is that how you got to this this type of enemy.

Nick Zaleski  56:26  
Originally, I wanted to have more analogues for stuff that was Mario Brothers and I wanted to do something where the main bad guys were all going to be pigs wearing Top Hats and suits and I wanted some kind of mechanic where you could stomp on their head when they get stuck in their hat and then you could pick the hat up and throw them but that just I couldn't think of any way to make that to work particularly well. So eventually, we decided to have a bunch of like different variants of mostly mostly pigs, the the main soldiers are all pigs and they've got different roles like you know, there's the bayonet piggy with the bolt action rifle, who's kind of tough to jump on.

Jonas Rosland  57:12  
i There's the hill there by them all the time. Because I'm used to jumping on top of things and all of a sudden, I'm like,

Nick Zaleski  57:21  
yeah, they're kind of I like to put them down in like low spots and spots where the player has to jump to do you know, kind of give them an extra, you know, obstacle.

Jonas Rosland  57:31  
Really appreciate that. Thank you.

Saun Conlin  57:35  
And I think the rats are more symbolic of like, kind of like quislings you know, they're, they're the part of the people that have like, also like sided with the capitalist. collaborators, pretty much collaborators. Yeah, exactly.

Eric Kesterson  57:50  
And just to pull Jimbo in, because we had, you might have found in the stuff that I sent you, there was like, a couple of older sort of concepts for this. And one time, like we got together, and are we, you know, when Jim was like, joining on we, we had to do like a sketch of like, just kind of some loose concept stuff. And the sort of general shape of these pigs came out of that. But for a while, like, I sort of took his sketch and like just did the crudest of pixel art over it. And so that it was like kind of shaped like how he sketched it, but

Jim Bochanski  58:36  
I would say you like pretty much like, traced it perfectly. The colors were kind of like you're not an artist, but for artists of color as well. Right. I made

Eric Kesterson  58:45  
I made like, slightly informed program or out of his, like, just pencil sketch accurate. Yeah. And then but what we're, what we're seeing above here is is Jim later than going through and re you know, detailing everything and like, personally, I'm, I'm super stoked with how everything looks now.

Jim Bochanski  59:05  
Yeah, they're like the darkness in their eyes. That's just derivative of Metal Gear Solid because I love that game. It's like, I like a really painterly style to it. Because when they were making it, they wanted it to look photo real, but the PlayStation One didn't have the graphical capacity. And I just carried it over to this because it's, like, cartoony anyway. And the main thing they could always be saying is like these piggies, they gotta like mean, and like, you know, not pleasant, and I kept drawing them like, like pseudo Kirby, they were like, cute looking. And I was just like, Well, shit, I gotta bring some grit into this.

Saun Conlin  59:39  
And that's actually what I really like about these guys. Because it mean, it helps to, you know, one of the things that Nick wanted to do was was basically make a game that essentially seemed like, you know this, the Soviets have wanted Soviet state sponsored team to develop a game you know, to like Basically battle that of what was coming out of the west, you know at the time. And so like what you have here like what I love it that artwork kind of like really works with that is that it's got that element of cutesy, you know, like, like Jimbo was mentioning but it also has that in a seriousness like the pigs, they all have that serious like determined look like, alright, yeah, you are you're fighting like a like a determined force. And, you know, we even had some kids who kind of like, some kids that we got to talk to Philadelphia, and like, they were kind of getting into it. They're like, Oh, yeah, let's let's, you know, let's fight these capitalist pigs. I was getting nervous. I was like, oh, man, we are. Youth here. Like, this is nuts. Like,

Jim Bochanski  1:00:46  
I artwork for the youth. Good.

Saun Conlin  1:00:49  
Yeah, it made me very nervous. Because we had like, the army behind us. And they were like, you know, they were very close to us. And they were like, they had like a shooter there that they were like, US Army. Like, go communism. I'm like, Oh, my God.

Jim Bochanski  1:01:10  
Oh, that was awesome. That was funny. It's like we can get us into Nick.

Jonas Rosland  1:01:19  
I definitely think that you, you captured the essence of menacing here and yeah,

Jim Bochanski  1:01:25  
yeah, I wasn't going for determined at all. It wasn't about being determined. It was about being like, evil and sinister. And you know, what? Propaganda, the way that propaganda would talk about an other but it wasn't determined as much. I would

Jonas Rosland  1:01:40  
even the boots are shiny. Yeah.

Jim Bochanski  1:01:43  
Right. That's, that's definitely a throw to like, like Mario, you know, bootable has got a little shine on them, at least in world and up. Not 64, because they didn't have specularity in Nintendo 64.

Saun Conlin  1:01:56  
But that in any military, any military worth its salt is going to have some shiny boots. So

Jim Bochanski  1:02:02  
yeah. Well, that's what I was thinking. But I guess you're right. Good conscience.

Jonas Rosland  1:02:08  
So the enemy here, the main boss picture that you you sent over as well. I'll show that here. I just love this. It's it's a really, really obese pig.

Jim Bochanski  1:02:27  
Yeah, my main influence was Tony Soprano, because I just finished watching the sopranos when I drew it. I mean, Nick was hanging out one day, and I just like, did a little sketch on my book. And I was like this, like, it's alright. And I did another one. He's like, Yeah, that's it. And that's pretty much like how it happened. It's just like, totally like, yeah, the sopranos was just like, in my unconscious mind. And it just kind of like, poured onto the page.

Jonas Rosland  1:02:50  
What's it? Yeah,

Saun Conlin  1:02:52  
sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Jonas.

Jonas Rosland  1:02:55  
Um, what's the the device that he holds in his hand?

Jim Bochanski  1:02:58  
Ah, yeah, that is a radio that he calls into when you're engaged in combat against this guy. And reinforcements parachute down from the ceiling. And they attack you. That's pretty much the gist that leave anything out, Nick? Or is that pretty much it?

Nick Zaleski  1:03:13  
Yeah, that's about it.

Jonas Rosland  1:03:16  
So as I was playing through the demo, I think it's for four stages was something like that in the demo. What's the intent of the span of the whole game?

Nick Zaleski  1:03:30  
You start out in the countryside, you make your way through the mountains down the coast into the main into, you know, the capital of the country, which is where the final, the final world is going to be, like a industrial city area.

Saun Conlin  1:03:48  
And we also got a little bit of a like, in each world, we kind of have like, a three little pigs type scenario going on, right? Where you're basically going in and you're Molotov in there, instead of blowing down their house, you're molotov and down their house. And they're all running to the end of the world. And actually, like, you know, congregating at the boss level and so you actually see the pigs You chased out the banker pigs, we call them, you see them, and you actually face them and they try to bribe you with coins, you know, in the tower there, you know, and don't don't take the coins because you know, it's kind of game over for you when you hit you get those coins. Not game over. But you you get you get the gist so Hey, overbed

Jonas Rosland  1:04:33  
so don't don't take money from the capitalist pigs.

Saun Conlin  1:04:36  
Absolutely. Don't don't accept their bribes.

Jonas Rosland  1:04:39  
I love it. I love it.

Jim Bochanski  1:04:41  
I'll hate you. And as you were saying that, those bayonets they really got you, huh? Yeah. You're welcome. I designed that. Gotcha.

Jonas Rosland  1:04:49  
Yeah, yeah. No, they are horrendous. And it's like, oh, I need to. There was one. I love the checkpoint system. Thank you. You for implementing the checkpoint system that is super helpful. That was what was Eric's doing. There was one point where I was like, I'm constantly dying. And I don't know, because I just want to run through things fast and just explore as much as possible. I'm like, I can't move fast enough to avoid everything. And I was getting hit by bayonets and bullets all over the place. And I was like, Okay, I need to take it slow. So I did that. Instead, a and the checkpoints really helped in in learning how the stages play out, instead of just dying at the same spot after playing through the beginnings while so thank you for checkpoints, I love those.

Eric Kesterson  1:05:43  
And to just like, give a number to your question, like what we're targeting is for worlds and the the worlds each have eight stages. And each stage so for Worlds.

Jonas Rosland  1:06:01  
That's 32 in total? Yep. Yep. Fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah, I am really eager to play more because this is this is my jam. As I said, this is awesome. Yeah, and

Eric Kesterson  1:06:15  
just you mentioned like, that's, that's 32 stages in the campaign. And then we're hoping for, you know, community levels to be featured, too, which is why like, even on the campaign, just in case, somebody missed it, we stuck a node on the world map, as you're walking through, that's a different color, hoping people will go over there and go, What is this, and then it just like, randomly gives you some community stages to try out.

Jonas Rosland  1:06:44  
So I did actually try that out. What was it called, again?

Saun Conlin  1:06:50  
forage in the common good, wasn't there

Eric Kesterson  1:06:54  
yet? Well, the industrial forage is what we call the level editor. And the common good is the community area. When you go, yeah, when you go for the, for the, from the main menu. But on the world map, it's it's just like a level node. And it just the idea there was just like, something to draw you towards that stuff. Because otherwise it's under like, extras in the main menu. So some people might kind of miss that or not, you know, not exactly notice it's there. But yeah, but it is, it is like a big, yeah, it's like an important to us an important part of the game. It's actually like, you know, one of the core things that that Nick wanted to do, I'm putting words in his mouth now, but that he wanted to do, like, you know, with a design document was like, have this, this level editor and ability to share things. So

Saun Conlin  1:07:47  
like how Nick wanted to make this game when Eric told him to come up with an idea.

Jonas Rosland  1:07:55  
I love having that random community level incorporated in the main map definitely speaks to you how you view community as well. And not just adding things onto your game, but actually being a part of your game. Can you tell me a bit more about the community levels and the limit editor and how that works?

Eric Kesterson  1:08:23  
Yeah. Nick, do you want to know, go ahead. So basically, so like I mentioned, it was part of the core design, like we want it, we knew we wanted to do this. And then it was self reinforcing. Because we like I, I made a level editor. And then Nick used it to make levels. And, you know, that informed like, Nick, using it informed what it should be like and made it better. So, you know, in a way, it's kind of important that like, we didn't just make our game and then put a level editor together. Like, the levels that you play through aren't made in that editor. They're not, you know, we're not like cheating and using different tools or something. So, yeah, it's sort of forced us to make sure that everything that we want to do can be done in there. And that it's not super painful to do it. It has a learning curve, but it's not, you know, over the years of Nick and Jim and, you know, a couple of other people using it, it's, it's gotten a lot more polished and a lot, you know, a lot easier to do. Whatever kind of you want,

Jim Bochanski  1:09:46  
within an I interject, yeah, I'd say to put it succinctly. It's a tool that has a lot of utility, and you can get a lot of things done with it really quickly and really efficiently. But you have to learn its quirks and it doesn't have guardrails. So like, if you have like a DIY spirit, you can get a lot done with it. Mario Maker is a little more round around the edges. And it's like safety. It's got safeties on everything, you know, because yeah, it's made for the general public, when Eric built, he cut yourself on it if you're not careful. But, uh, beyond that, it's got a lot of use, like, it lifts a lot, it does a lot of heavy lifting really, like, you know, really efficiently. So.

Eric Kesterson  1:10:30  
Yeah. This is also what it's like. So this is like, the third probably version of the game, like, we've kind of started over a couple of times. And it's probably the second version of the level editor. So, you know, we've kind of had iteration to, you know, be able to get it to where it is now, where we, where we think like, it's pretty good. Like, there's, there are still things about, you know, the editor of the game, of course, because we're in Early Access, like, it's not quite perfect yet. But we've iterated so much that like, you know, we all feel pretty good about it. And, you know, in a sense, like, like, believing it like that's like why we were willing to do things like go to the conventions and stuff. It's like, you we don't know anything about game marketing. None of us, like do that. But we believe in the thing and if we can get people to look at it, and try it, like, it'll speak for itself, and you know,

awesome, Nick, I don't know if there's anything you want to say about like, what, like, what it's like for you making

Nick Zaleski  1:11:47  
now, I can really think of it's just, it's, I think it's one of the core, you know, features of our game. That was one thing that I right off the bat wanted to make sure that we had in our game was like a simple level editor. So that, you know, we can hopefully build a community around it. That's about it. How do you

Jonas Rosland  1:12:11  
what's your thought process when you when you build out a new level?

Nick Zaleski  1:12:16  
Usually, I just start with a blank screen and I build it kind of like screen by screen and kind of test it as I'm building it.

Jonas Rosland  1:12:28  
You have these themes as well within the different worlds?

Nick Zaleski  1:12:33  
Yeah, usually I try like the levels they're mostly like nonsensical, kind of like in a Mario game, but I try to have some kind of real world location to kind of inspire and inform how I build the build a level. But that's about the only pre planning that goes into it. Like I'll decide like, you know, I don't know what to do, let's make something that somewhat resembles a farm let's make something that somewhat resembles a vineyard or but I've just found that if you try to plan too much you wind up like kind of boxing yourself in so I just try not to do too, too much planning ahead of time.

Jonas Rosland  1:13:22  
I love it. I love it. So the level editor makes it easy for you to go back and fix things if if it doesn't work out.

Nick Zaleski  1:13:31  
Yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.

Jonas Rosland  1:13:36  
Awesome. I wanted to briefly before we dive into some some concept art and and stuff like that, I wanted to briefly talk about the music within the game as well. So who, who came up with the music choice of the game?

Nick Zaleski  1:13:55  
I knew right off the bat that we wanted to do do some kind of Soviet propaganda music. And yeah, I chose the the Soviet anthem for like, kind of like the main theme and Eric he chose the other music from a bunch of other Soviet propaganda stuff he found online.

Eric Kesterson  1:14:19  
Yeah. So while you know, we've got team members with music background, none of us are like strong in music production. Or, or really like composing like, large pieces or with you know, lots of instruments. So, really, all of the music that's in there is, you know, public domain stuff that I was able to find MIDI online. And what I say is I arranged it, you know, so I did like, I did, like, instrument samples that were like really, really, really Short in, in their length, so that they have to like repeat. And that's what gives it the kind of SNES sound at least that's what it was kind of going for. So it's not like a perfect representation, but it's kind of close to how how music was done on on SNES with actual, you know, samples with a just like extremely short, repeating musical instrument samples. And then so I, I created the samples and then arranged on to maybe of, you know, public domain, old marches and various types of songs like that. And like Nick said, the Soviet anthem with the idea, like, we would like to add more, and, you know, some original stuff might get composed in there eventually as well to like intermix with it. But, yeah, that's not I arranged it, but I'm not not like claiming credit for composing it, because those are compositions by you know, very, very talented, mostly dead, Soviet composers.

Jonas Rosland  1:16:20  
Is this a call out for someone? join you as a musician? Maybe. All right. Let's dig into some concept art. On how you how you put things, pen to paper and things like that. And then we'll dive into tax a little more. We'll start off with this one here.

Jim Bochanski  1:16:53  
Yeah, so when I started on this piece is definitely very early on. And I just wanted to create something to like, capture a moment, that wasn't necessarily gameplay, but it was just more about like, what the world was, and like, what immersion could feel like. And I would give a nod to a lot of the concept art in Donkey Kong Country too, because they, they took the 3d models for that game, I wouldn't call it concept art, but just like their, like their bumper renders, if you if you will, they took their 3d models, and they do like really high res renders of them. And I always like loved them, you never really see them, like they're not the players manual, you would only see them if you like, had certain issues in Nintendo Power. But they were just really cool storytelling pieces. And they use the like, unique camera angles. So that's pretty much that's where this came from. It's just you go on Google, if you type Donkey Kong Country to concept art, you'll see what I'm talking about.

Jonas Rosland  1:17:52  
Awesome. Yeah. Let's see. This one.

Eric Kesterson  1:17:59  
That's like, a sketch from like, the very beginning that I did, and then colored it in. And I'm not that talented of an artist. So yeah, there's there's a lot of very, very crude art in this game for a long time. Until we brought, you know, gym in and gave everything. A nice shine.

Jim Bochanski  1:18:28  
I will say there was an artist that you hired to do all the settings. I didn't do the environment art. Oh, yeah, that's yeah, I don't want to take all the credit. But yeah, the character. Yeah.

Eric Kesterson  1:18:39  
Yeah. Like our world tiles, like the the ground and walls and stuff are Yeah, we like contracted that out. But

Jim Bochanski  1:18:47  
they're just so like, put the art that was in the distant background. It was also art by that artists that Eric's talking about. But when I originally joined, and I would play the game, what would happen is my eyes would get like, really distracted because that background I was so who's so highly detailed. But what I did is I said, Hey, look at Super Mario World, right? That game has hills, and they're pretty much solid color. And it's got mountains, also solid color, maybe like three or four tones. But it wasn't a lot of visual variety. Because when you're like playing the game, you know, you've got all these soldier pigs and there's bullets flying and there's grenades. And that's already like visually, it's like asking a lot of the player they got a lot of different things to pay attention to. And so I didn't necessarily crale The backgrounds, but I was a bit of like a, like a artistic director just to, you know, take what the background had, and tone it down so that when someone's playing the game, they're able to focus on the, you know, the obstacles, navigate the game successfully. That's like a big part of game design that you wouldn't really think about unless you actually had a hand in it and succeeded. You know, But that's pulling off something like that.

Eric Kesterson  1:20:02  
Yeah, so even the things Jim didn't directly create, like, every basically everything has, we've leaned heavily on his, you know, artistic eye for, you know, like, are things reading properly and you know, can you see what's happening? And is it distracting and all the things, you know, like you just said?

Jim Bochanski  1:20:24  
Yeah, I mean, when it comes down to it, like games have art, they aren't art. So if you put are in a game, and it has to serve the game for you're doing it wrong.

Jonas Rosland  1:20:36  
We have this really early sketch of Baron van link, does it?

Nick Zaleski  1:20:42  
So yeah, oink. Yeah,

Eric Kesterson  1:20:45  
that was me misinterpreting. I think Nick's notes because we have we have a guy in a plane who throws bombs. And we had flying pigs. And I think like, I just, like, conflated them all into one thing. So I drew a guy with like wings, throwing bombs, and having like, the flight helmet on or something. And again, this yeah, there's, it's like a little diagram on the side about the bombs basically, like just to show that he throws them, they fall down. But they land because they've got legs, and then they start walking around. You know, kind of, we're calling them smart bombs. I think the only thing smart about him is like when they land they'll start walking in the direction that the players in otherwise.

Jonas Rosland  1:21:40  
Yeah, yeah. And this one is a bit of a level here and we've got a radio tower, we've got a pig with a bayonet.

Jim Bochanski  1:21:54  
And it's a little bit more of a my love for Metal Gear just accidentally seeping into the art. Definitely, like what that's all about it barbed wire fence. Yeah. I mean, like they were talking about the pigs being soldiers. And that might be like the first piece of art that had the bayonet in it.

Nick Zaleski  1:22:15  
I can't see what we're seeing my screen is frozen.

Eric Kesterson  1:22:21  
It's one of the one of Jim's sketches there, where it's like, it almost looks like a like a bass, but there's like a radio tower on it. I don't know if you remember it, but that might be. I don't know, that. Like Jim said, that might be the first one that had to be in it. i That might not be the one that like, first used to fill the role. It's

Jim Bochanski  1:22:43  
all about the one that you traced. Yeah. The one that you traced is from that one where it's mellower, like zoomed up. But he's also like, kind of bizarre looking. Because he's Yeah, yeah. I mean, if that's in the list, I won't talk about it now. But I think I know what you're talking about. Does it have like a signpost and a radish in it? I believe. Let's see. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. It's not that one. Not that one either, actually. But there's a few things to say about that one, too. Like, so in the artwork. There's like a few different stages to the bandit pig in that picture. There's him just like an alert. And then there's him getting squished. And it didn't exactly end up in the game that way. But this arts definitely what led to the idea of like, when you land and like step on them what it looks like, cuz like a year, maybe two years ago, everything would just it would like it would be like a like just the stagnant picks. It's very low

Eric Kesterson  1:23:55  
down and then just like

Jim Bochanski  1:23:56  
yeah, it was Eric doing like the best he could which was it wasn't bad at communicate it was going on. But yeah, like being able to squish them. That came from this piece of art, I would say it was like concept art lending to gameplay content.

Jonas Rosland  1:24:13  
Right, let me let me see if I can find the the other picture and that we talked about. I think that's in the other concept art piece here.

Jim Bochanski  1:24:24  
See? That's the one. Yeah. So this was like when I first heard about the idea. I hadn't really done anything for them yet, but they were telling me about it. And I was interested because I mean, when I first heard the like Marxist twins, my instinct was instantly like, wow, as far as creating something that grabs people's attention, that's gold. Like it's it's clever, and it's funny. And so they're like, Yeah, this is they give you a physical description and he's got The Russian hat. He's got facial hair, overalls, capitalist pigs. And I took that and I pretty much fused it with John Chris Loski from like Ren and Stimpy. That was pretty much the main influence. And I remember it was hilarious because I showed the Nick and he's just like, Jimbo that's hideous. Like, this character is not like, not supposed to be nightmarish to look at and just like, oh, yeah, all right, I'll reel it back. And we had an intermediate style. At one point, though, it was I would say, like, at the beginning of the pandemic, I had a lot of downtime. So I busted out like, a bunch of sprites for the player character. And they were like, really like, like, soft anime, like appealing looking characters. But it kind of seemed like they, they were too, like too flat, in a sense. So I went up drawing a little bit from this at the end, like the version that you see now. It's the it's like, 10% of this picture at this point. I would say like 30% Little Mario and Super Mario World, and then the rest of like, whatever, I guess. 60% Yeah, that's just what the game needed. What the game called for. Yeah. Yes, it's like a little, little John Kay, a little 16 bit, you know? Yeah. It was a very organic process. And it involved a lot of debate over the course of several years to get the the final design that we landed on. So yeah, I think it's like a it definitely makes me think of the phrase art through adversity.

Eric Kesterson  1:26:36  
And this one is back to the era of me literally sketching in a notebook. I think you could see the notebook lines there.

Jim Bochanski  1:26:44  
I wasn't there yet.

Eric Kesterson  1:26:46  
Yeah. Which is again, why this is so much worse looking.

Jonas Rosland  1:26:54  
I think it's lovely to see these and of course, the pig boss here.

Yeah, it's

Jim Bochanski  1:27:02  
that face.

Eric Kesterson  1:27:05  
I'm happy with with the one we have, but I do I do still kind of like that. For me, like I'm gonna I'm gonna pretend like I was a good enough artists to like actually take some inspiration from something and say that like that's supposed to be there that's like, inspired by you know, maybe what was What's his last night old man? Is it like Thompson or something from Beavis and Butthead? Who just like wandering around?

Saun Conlin  1:27:35  
It's got a very awesome, it's got like a ditch racing vibe to it.

Eric Kesterson  1:27:39  
But he's not but he's obviously like, you know, more menacing, he's alive, lot angrier and happier to be doing bad. But, you know,

Jim Bochanski  1:27:48  
it does kind of look like like crude like judge art. It's a that's maybe why I'm cracking up on it. Like, it's like almost real, but not quite.

Eric Kesterson  1:27:59  
Over Yeah, I think that's this is the one that we sketched. Yeah, this that was Jimbo sketch that I traced and turned into the, that version of the character that was yeah, it was what we had for a couple years,

Jim Bochanski  1:28:21  
it looked like a clean version of this character. Like the, the proportions of the feet were more even than in my drawing. But otherwise, it is like basically like the brother of this character, which I will say is very derivative of Monty Mole from Super Mario World. Like that character. There. It's just like a cycle a Kirby's shaped lump with a face and feet. And it's pretty much like the whole just just like, slapped soldier pig onto that template. So, yeah, I love It's where it all comes from. Yeah,

Jonas Rosland  1:28:54  
I love it. Before we wrap up, I want to pull things back a bit to PAX we we've been talking about backpacks and conferences in general a lot here. And just a few days ago, we're very recently at least you, you announced that you are part of Pax ricing. Tell us more about what what is Pax rising and what are you going to do there?

Eric Kesterson  1:29:23  
So yeah, PAX, well, Pax. To be clear, there was a Pax rising sort of area of PAX East, and we weren't part of that. We just like bought our own booths and went to PAX and we were, you know, just did our own thing there. But then we got contacted by by them by Pax one of the I don't know I guess sales there or whatever it is outreach people or whatever. And they put together Yeah, packs rising online, which is next month. And so what's going to happen there is we cut together a two minute video that gave from Penny Arcade. And I think it's Chris Straub another Well, I, I only know him as a as a webcomic. artist he is, you know, I'm not sure if he does more stuff than that. But he's he's also sort of associated with with Penny Arcade somehow. They're going to be like watching these videos of the games. And I guess offering their commentary, I'm not sure it's about an hour and a half. So they're gonna, they're gonna watch Yeah, they're gonna watch through the videos for all the games. And then there's like two schedules for that for Saturday and Sunday. And what it is, is, like one side of things is a constant stream of games. So every half hour, there's a different game. That's got a video playing, like a let's play style with the devs. So we recorded a Let's Play. And we'll be hanging out on Discord like text chatting with people. While that's going on. And then yeah, yeah. And the other part of the schedule is there's like, roundtable discussions and various kinds of other events. I'll be taking part in one of those. I think I forget if it's on Sunday or something. But yeah, the main like, that's, that's more like, just discussion amongst developers about development. And for, for, like actually showing and promoting the game, it's going to be that video at the beginning plus our like, half hour. Let's play.

Jonas Rosland  1:31:56  
That's nothing. That's really

Eric Kesterson  1:31:58  
yeah, we're hoping and I guess they said there's going to be a steam event or something for it. So we're hoping that that that? Well, well, my big hope is that steam puts that on the front of their page, because that's like the single biggest bump we got in wishlists was like, while we were at PAX, our game was listed in this the steam event for PAX East, you know, so there were so many games at PAX East that like, sometimes I went to that steam event, and I had to like scroll to the bottom and say, load more, scroll down, load more, scroll down load more, and then I like, found our game on there. But like it was random. So you know, sometimes we would come up closer to the top or whatever. But with tax rising, it's there's not as many games so hopefully, if they do a steam thing, and they put it on the page, we're behind only like one click of load more this time and yeah, maybe, you know, maybe we'll get some visibility out of that. So I'm actually hoping or not hoping will by then because it's a month away to actually have a an update for the demo. Because as we've been going in Early Access, we've you know, we've kept improving the game and and putting more into it. And the demo is some months behind. I think it might have last been built in February.

Jim Bochanski  1:33:24  
Maybe it was a no, no. But when you

Eric Kesterson  1:33:27  
really the demo that you can get on Steam is actually different than what we were demoing at PAX. So yeah. I hope anyway, hoping to put a an update out to the demo and stuff to to coincide with that. So

Jonas Rosland  1:33:44  
it's pretty cool. Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to it. I'll be there checking, checking everything out and see the lesson play as well that that's going to be super fun. And I

Eric Kesterson  1:33:55  
think is that's because it's like an online thing that's like free for anybody to attend. Right?

Jonas Rosland  1:34:01  
I think so. Yeah. Yeah. I hope so.

Eric Kesterson  1:34:06  
Yeah, I mean, I do too, because that means the most possible people,

Jonas Rosland  1:34:11  
for sure, for sure. So we this has been a fantastic time with you all. We have to wrap up otherwise our listeners are going to go do something else. This has been super, super fun. Talking to you all. Please let let us know if you have any shoutouts first of all, to someone or if and if you have any shoutouts to someone and also where we can find you online. We'll start with Eric.

Eric Kesterson  1:34:45  
Yeah, you can find us on Steam supermarkets twins. I'm on Twitter at type three underscore VESA. I'm not a super effective Twitter user, but I'm there and Do we got a discord also, which you can find linked from our Steam page or our website? It's all everything links together back and forth every which way. So find a somewhere and you'll find us everywhere.

Jonas Rosland  1:35:14  
Awesome Shan

Saun Conlin  1:35:18  
Shan you're muted. Awesome. The big guy that Nick chased off the camera there was his brother Rick, he did actually did a lot of work to help us get some of the shirts produced. So I want to thank him as you know, for for his help there. And I also wanted to do a shout out to Lena we met with we met Lena at PAX. We actually met a lot of excellent interested people. And you know, we decided to actually touch base with Lena and you know some of the work you actually see here you know, like the jetpack pig, the worksheet did some work on that. So wanted to say, you know, hey Lena and thank you

Jonas Rosland  1:36:04  
awesome. Do you want to share where where people can find you online? Or is it just a discord? Or neck? Nick?

Eric Kesterson  1:36:14  
I mentioned me talking to you specifically. I think I'm sorry, I did not want to be found online. He would prefer you'd prefer to leave him alone actually.

Saun Conlin  1:36:27  
Perfectly. I live in a basement. So I used to live in the basement. That's where I was doing the work but yes, I do not want to be found Thank you.

Nick Zaleski  1:36:39  
Same here I would rather not be found online. Go on Jim.

Jim Bochanski  1:36:43  
I cannot be found online for I have no internet presence.

Eric Kesterson  1:36:47  
You see how great it is to try to like to try to like get attention. It's like me, like introverted programmer, like, please pay attention to the thing.

Jim Bochanski  1:37:02  
I would say I've been like focused so much and just helping make art and helping promote like the production of the game itself. I haven't spent any time developing any kind of internet presence other than like occasionally talking on the Discord. I would say like of all the things we have the discord is really the ones that focus on. That's like where we have like the most sense of community. I have nothing else to add.

Jonas Rosland  1:37:26  
Fantastic.

Nick Zaleski  1:37:29  
All right, yeah. As I said, I prefer not to be found online. Not much of a presence. And if I'm gonna give a shout out, I'll give a shout out to Eric's wife for letting us borrow her husband for Game Dev stuff.

Jonas Rosland  1:37:47  
Love it. I love it. Oh, thank you all. My name is Jonas Rosland. You can find me online everywhere @jonasrosland. And you can check us out, right? Yes, you can check us out at hitsave.org as usual as well. Thank you again, Eric, Saun, Jim and Nick. This has been fantastic. I really, really appreciate it talking to you all and I can't wait to see what comes next for the game. Thank you all.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:16  
Thanks.
