00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
hello everyone and welcome to yet another hit save podcast this time we're doing a deep dive into the

00:07.680 --> 00:15.920
keitai phone game japanese phone game preservation that's happening and i got four

00:15.920 --> 00:21.360
lovely people with me here today we got ellen cooper who's also a board member here at hit save

00:21.360 --> 00:30.880

00:30.880 --> 00:41.280
cosmo also known as max and we got yubi hi everyone hello hi hey how's it going so before we kick off

00:41.280 --> 00:46.480
with all the technical stuff and all the games that you have preserved in the past year i would

00:46.480 --> 00:53.280
like you all to introduce yourself to the audience here so we can start off in the same order as we

00:53.280 --> 01:02.880
did in the introduction here so ellen sure hi i'm ellen i am a board member for hit save i am also

01:02.880 --> 01:10.480
the founder of keitai wiki which is a wiki dedicated to recording information on japanese phone games i

01:10.480 --> 01:19.120
have involvement in the hardware and software parts of um feature phone hacking and i also

01:19.120 --> 01:26.480
just do a lot of general organization um with regards to the wiki and to the community awesome

01:26.480 --> 01:36.480
stephanie uh yeah so um i'm stephanie and i work on scroll jamie which is a java me8 virtual machine

01:36.480 --> 01:44.480
and i've been working on that since 2016 and pretty much i've been working on dojo support and mint piece

01:44.480 --> 01:53.600
support so western and i guess eastern phones and that's been going pretty well uh keitai wiki wise

01:54.320 --> 02:01.040
um i don't really do much apart from you know sometimes i help out yubi when he's doing the reverse

02:01.040 --> 02:16.720
engineering so basically i know lots of java so awesome awesome and uh max hi yeah i'm max also

02:16.720 --> 02:22.400
known online as rockman cosmo um i'm a game preservationist who specializes in japanese feature

02:22.400 --> 02:28.640
phone games so i'm kind of like like the leading advocate i guess for the preservation of these games

02:28.640 --> 02:34.800
but i've also done some of the preservation work myself but yeah since i think like since the imo

02:34.800 --> 02:40.880
shut down in november 2021 i guess i've dedicated too much of my life to preserving these kinds of

02:40.880 --> 02:46.480
games it's kind of consumed me but it's also led me to you know come across all these wonderful people

02:46.480 --> 02:52.240
that are on these podcasts and yeah i continue to spread awareness and actually last summer as i'll

02:52.240 --> 02:58.480
discuss later i actually spoke at two conferences on this so it's been a wonderful past year

02:58.880 --> 03:05.920
awesome and last but not least yubi hey how's it going uh yubi or sometimes you might see me as a

03:05.920 --> 03:11.920
yubi app uh on the socials uh kind of the i don't know new guy to the team i guess the best way of

03:11.920 --> 03:16.560
putting it uh i don't know how long i've been here maybe like almost a year now probably eight months

03:16.560 --> 03:23.200
nine months all around there uh primarily focus on a reverse engineering of server-based

03:23.200 --> 03:30.960
uh i mode games or even just tool creation of any kind uh previously mostly i'm a translation guy

03:30.960 --> 03:36.560
doing all the hacking for getting translations from japanese english and then kind of took my skill

03:36.560 --> 03:49.040
sets and uh use them for good now on the keitai side so so what i do awesome awesome so i wanted to dive

03:49.040 --> 03:57.680
into the keitai wiki a bit and start off there so ellen you started the keitai wiki a while ago

03:58.480 --> 04:06.240
yes i started yeah sorry i started it in august of 2023 so it's getting close to uh two years about a

04:06.240 --> 04:14.640
year and a half so what is it what what's the keitai wiki about the keitai wiki is a collection of

04:14.640 --> 04:23.040
information about japanese feature phone games applications and other related media it's a place

04:23.040 --> 04:29.520
that records a lot of this information in english which is not written about on almost any other

04:29.520 --> 04:39.440
sites so it's a treasure trove for anyone who wants to get into preserving japanese phones and

04:39.440 --> 04:45.760
phone games absolutely but that being said even though it's getting close to two years old the

04:45.760 --> 04:53.200
wiki is definitely still in the early phases that's still a lot of pages that need to be made there are

04:53.200 --> 04:58.960
thousands of games released and while we have a lot of the important ones and a lot of the ones

04:58.960 --> 05:05.840
that we have found on the wiki there is still way more to be said and way more to be written and added

05:05.840 --> 05:17.840
yeah looking at the keitai phones and the games that were on these phones they weren't really here in

05:17.840 --> 05:27.120
the western part of the world at all they were over there in japan uh had a an immense catalog of games

05:27.120 --> 05:35.440
and fantastic really really cool phones as well that um were very advanced for the time yeah um

05:35.440 --> 05:44.480
on that note there was actually one phone that was released in the us uh i forgot what the model was

05:44.480 --> 05:53.920
exactly but it was like the only dojo phone that was released here and they called it m mode instead of

05:53.920 --> 06:07.040
like i mode but uh basically they wanted to uh actually found that out from there's the

06:08.800 --> 06:14.960
video game history foundation they made that archive with all the information so i did a search on there

06:14.960 --> 06:22.960
and then i found that that phone was actually talked about in one of the game magazines oh so that was like

06:22.960 --> 06:30.560
really cool that was really cool so like that archive popped up and just learned something from it

06:30.560 --> 06:37.200
pretty quickly um obviously it was a business oriented phone and you know that was the only phone and

06:37.840 --> 06:45.920
after that uh it didn't do anything else with it so it kind of was a a flop

06:45.920 --> 06:56.640
uh bad uh i've been watching all the uh the clips that you all post about uh the games that you have

06:56.640 --> 07:06.080
preserved and it's so it's so cool to see all these games that were made for phones before we had the

07:06.080 --> 07:13.520
iphone and android phones and things like that and the way they run they run really well many of them and

07:13.520 --> 07:22.400
they're fantastic ports some of them uh many of them are original games so max maybe you can fill us in

07:22.400 --> 07:30.400
on some of the notable finds that you have done in the past year 100 yeah there have been so many

07:30.400 --> 07:35.200
crazy finds it's like i had a i was writing this whole notes for myself here and i realized just how

07:35.200 --> 07:42.000
many games we found in the past year and actually recently we did pass the 800 mark for idmo games at

07:42.000 --> 07:47.600
least so now over 800 i mode games are preserved so that's that's unbelievable because if you remember

07:47.600 --> 07:53.600
only like two years ago it was like zero so that's the incredible growth but yeah on onto this more

07:53.600 --> 08:01.920
specific games um let's see so i want to start from last may and go to the present so may uh we had the

08:01.920 --> 08:09.200
easy web versions of the rockman.exe games preserved so if you remember uh megaman battle network had two

08:09.200 --> 08:15.360
original entries on katai and we had preserved the imode versions but there is a competitor service

08:15.360 --> 08:21.280
by kddi called easy web and that's actually where those two games were originally released

08:21.280 --> 08:29.040
so thanks to the expertise of craze we were able to extract those games but also another side

08:29.040 --> 08:34.800
application called battler's tower which had like online leaderboards but because that has a network

08:34.800 --> 08:39.600
check we have not been able to crack it but it's kind of crazy that we found another copy of those

08:39.600 --> 08:46.800
already rare games then a month later in june we partially preserved a game called oi katamari

08:46.800 --> 08:54.560
damasi kun and if you remember the psp entry in the katamari series me and my katamari the end credits

08:54.560 --> 09:00.000
has this mini game where you're rolling a katamari but it's like in this pixel style and it's in 2d

09:00.000 --> 09:05.600
and you and you go side to side basically and you go along this long stage so basically they said what

09:05.600 --> 09:10.160
if we just take that end credits mini game and make an entirely original game out of it by just adding a

09:10.160 --> 09:16.960
bunch of you know original stages and that's what oi katamari damasi kun was so i i forget how many

09:16.960 --> 09:22.560
stages we have in particular but it's not all of them but we do have a good amount so we did preserve

09:22.560 --> 09:29.920
that in june and then in july if you remember from two years back naoya shinoda was the first guest on

09:29.920 --> 09:36.240
here alongside with me um he scored a massive square enix imode game hall after like years of

09:36.240 --> 09:44.400
negotiations so he preserved about 19 games um including a partial copy of before crisis final

09:44.400 --> 09:50.640
fantasy 7 which uv will talk about later that's its own can of worms but also the full copy of

09:50.640 --> 09:57.440
kingdom hearts coded dirge of cerberus lost episode now those two games are missing their sd card data

09:57.440 --> 10:03.840
but actually as i speak right now um naoya is working on obtaining that sd card data but we also

10:03.840 --> 10:10.240
found numerous kingdom hearts imode mini games um even final fantasy 7 snowboarding which was actually

10:10.240 --> 10:17.200
the first imode game to have its leaderboards restored um thanks to uv again um and then also

10:17.200 --> 10:24.560
even the full imode remake of of saiken densetsu which was a game boy game but they actually had a full like

10:24.560 --> 10:31.680
color remake of it that was exclusive to imode and then let's see what else do we have here in july

10:31.680 --> 10:38.000
um ellen preserved tetris dj which is a rhythm based tetris game uh yeah she she's extremely proud

10:38.000 --> 10:44.960
of that one it's a really fun game in and of itself um in august uv preserved the entirety of professor

10:44.960 --> 10:50.720
layton and the mansion of the deathly mayor that was an original professor layton um game and that was

10:50.720 --> 10:56.160
it's actually canon to the series too which is very interesting um interestingly the phone that he

10:56.160 --> 11:02.240
preserved it from it it was horribly burnt like the screen wasn't working so i said it looks like it

11:02.240 --> 11:07.440
got burnt in a house fire but then all the gaming news websites they saw i said that and they reported

11:07.440 --> 11:13.520
it like it was fact so now everyone thinks the phone did survive a house fire but we don't know for

11:13.520 --> 11:22.880
sure um yeah then september uv once again preserves nine capcom imode games including an original imode

11:22.880 --> 11:28.480
capcom rpg called your planet where it's like a spherical 3d overworld so it's kind of like

11:28.480 --> 11:33.440
if you walked around a planet in mario galaxy that's kind of like your overworld basically with

11:33.440 --> 11:41.520
traditional turn-based combat then december before crisis strikes again except this time the demo is

11:41.520 --> 11:48.560
preserved from um an easy web phone by the one and only craze and it turns out that the data from

11:48.560 --> 11:55.280
that can be combined with the documo copy as uv will also get into and yes i mean there's so many

11:55.280 --> 12:01.120
more but if i had to pick one that was recent it would have to be an anonymous user preserving the

12:01.120 --> 12:08.640
entirety of xenosaga pied piper this was this is a massive find because it was six separate apps but it

12:08.640 --> 12:14.560
is a canonical story set i for i think it's before the first xenosaga game but people have been

12:14.560 --> 12:19.760
searching this for this for so long that after i posted the news a lot of people told me that they

12:19.760 --> 12:25.760
legitimately like broke into tears upon hearing it like i didn't realize that so many people had

12:25.760 --> 12:32.400
wanted this game for so long so that was very recently earlier in march which is when we're recording

12:32.400 --> 12:37.840
this but yeah it's very recent someone's already working on a fan translation of it that's amazing

12:38.720 --> 12:42.960
it's it's just been an incredible time i could go on forever about the games but yeah those are some

12:42.960 --> 12:52.720
of the best hits i mean just you're talking about games that have been locked away i think we maybe we

12:52.720 --> 12:58.240
should take a little step back here because the when we talk about i mode and the phones that we're

12:58.240 --> 13:05.280
talking about here they many of them are reliant on the network to be available and the i mode network

13:05.280 --> 13:14.000
was shut down years ago um so you can no longer download these games uh and they are on phones

13:14.000 --> 13:21.680
that have been stuffed in drawers essentially and and uh forgotten by the world for over a decade

13:21.680 --> 13:31.200
exactly so finding them and being able to restore them and show them to people is just a wonderful

13:31.200 --> 13:38.160
thing so thank you everyone for everything that you're doing here so tell me a bit about the latent

13:38.160 --> 13:46.480
game that was saved there uh because that was um a a full latent game and you said it was canonical as

13:46.480 --> 13:54.000
well yeah i'm not sure about this i guess the specific things i actually have not uh played a

13:54.000 --> 14:00.720
latent game myself so i'm not the best person to be talking about this but um but it seems like it

14:00.720 --> 14:07.520
i think it takes place between some of some of the ds games but yeah interestingly in comparison to

14:07.520 --> 14:12.160
some of the other games like they could have made this a server-based game because as you said

14:12.160 --> 14:18.480
um like the average size for an imode game if the audience doesn't know was one megabyte which is

14:19.040 --> 14:24.720
that that's not very big basically so a lot of games had to resort to creative ways to i guess

14:24.720 --> 14:30.000
overcome this limit so some of them as we have mentioned like rockman dash five islands or kingdom hearts

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
coded use the sd card for the extra data and some games like before crisis were jerks and decided to

14:36.000 --> 14:41.360
just rely on a server for the whole thing but professor layton and as well as actually xenosaga like

14:41.360 --> 14:46.560
i mentioned earlier they decided to split their game into separate apps so each so there i think

14:46.560 --> 14:52.080
there's six chapters in professor layton in the mansion of deathly mayor and there's one app for

14:52.080 --> 14:58.640
each chapter so basically that makes preserving it a little more difficult because you do have to find

14:58.640 --> 15:04.960
a phone with all six chapters but lo and behold uv's luck you know it just happened to work and

15:04.960 --> 15:10.240
he happened to find a phone with all six chapters on it and the same goes for xenosaga that was also

15:10.240 --> 15:18.720
also three chapters but each chapter had to be split into two apps so that's how that game came out and

15:18.720 --> 15:24.720
yeah they apparently released a remix version of it too um that was called a it was called it had the

15:24.720 --> 15:29.520
same name but it had a remix at the end and that one actually has different puzzles slightly better

15:29.520 --> 15:35.840
animations and even slightly different dialogues so we have not found that version yet but there is video

15:35.840 --> 15:41.280
footage of it online but it's also interesting just think like the fact that they would re-release an

15:41.280 --> 15:50.000
i-mode game you know it's interesting yeah those during the time i had a string of good luck i felt with phones

15:50.000 --> 16:05.360
yeah and also um on top of that there is the uh you have the scratchpad and stuff so it's kind of like

16:05.360 --> 16:12.800
dlc so scratchpad is like the storage space for the software and normally you'd use it for like

16:14.560 --> 16:19.440
game state or you know whatever else like contacts or whatever else and you know whatever

16:19.440 --> 16:27.120
software software to keep it state but since the size of the programs were pretty limited

16:28.240 --> 16:33.920
and the scratchpad could be much larger basically what would happen is that they would download from

16:33.920 --> 16:40.000
a server and cache that information in the scratchpad and then load it from that scratchpad

16:40.000 --> 16:51.680
so basically if the app was downloaded but never ran then it would never have gotten that scratchpad

16:51.680 --> 17:01.520
initialized and that's another issue as well with a lot of the software and titles so basically

17:01.520 --> 17:07.360
basically there have been cases where we found you know incomplete titles

17:08.800 --> 17:15.760
essentially and sometimes complete titles that were you know trial locked

17:18.160 --> 17:26.320
um oh one thing i want to add is um so the remix version um i don't recall if you said this in the in

17:26.320 --> 17:31.440
the same order but the remix version is for the professor laden there is not a remix version of

17:31.440 --> 17:38.720
xenosaga pied piper yes yeah for a moment i thought that's what you said and i was like what no no i'm not

17:38.720 --> 17:42.240
gonna drop that on you guys no way i'm gonna do that

17:46.720 --> 17:55.520
so uv i wanted to dive into the the burnt phone here that max was talking about a bit uh and that

17:55.520 --> 18:03.040
was the game where the latent game on it so when you when you got that phone what did you what did you

18:03.040 --> 18:11.040
think was going to happen uh let's see so this is back i don't know how many months ago that was but

18:11.040 --> 18:16.080
back when i was getting a string of a lot of lots and so i think roughly probably got two three hundred

18:16.080 --> 18:22.560
phones in some lot that i got and a lot of those phones i mean you know they all look normally used

18:22.560 --> 18:27.680
they all just kind of somebody used them in their lifetime right but this one in particular was just

18:27.680 --> 18:31.520
kind of out and i actually had set it to the side for quite some time because it was not

18:31.520 --> 18:38.160
booting correctly to which uh normally what i do is if i get a phone i'll try and turn it on see what

18:38.160 --> 18:42.960
apps there are and then there's nothing of value i set it into a box that is kind of my junk box

18:42.960 --> 18:48.720
right and then if there's things on there that i need i put it into a dump pile oh this phone i set

18:48.720 --> 18:54.800
aside there because it didn't turn on at first but uh because we felt like we had to make sure and

18:54.800 --> 19:00.960
normally when i do this i'll i'll put the phone in to get dumped and so ended up we actually dumped

19:00.960 --> 19:08.320
this phone um before i even got it working and turning on uh and the condition of it was not

19:08.320 --> 19:14.240
great uh and so this is kind of where the meme of a house fire phone came because actually if you look

19:14.240 --> 19:20.640
at the phone physically it looks like it had some charring of some sort to it or or it was in a very

19:20.640 --> 19:27.200
nasty place that gave it that type of look um and so you look at the phone you look at the connector

19:27.200 --> 19:34.400
port for uh uh where the charger cable goes and our debug cable goes it was uh not so nice and so

19:34.400 --> 19:40.320
with a little bit of cleaning and uh just was able to plug it in thankfully it turned on and we were able

19:40.320 --> 19:46.240
to dump the contents but of course when i dumped it i had no idea what was on this phone that i was just

19:46.240 --> 19:53.520
expecting there to be nothing but if i recall this is the phone that gave us lots more than just

19:53.520 --> 20:00.720
latent as well i think it had tons of other namco and konami not konami but uh namco games on it as

20:00.720 --> 20:07.760
well uh so it was quite a gold find for us especially with all the latent games and uh what ended up

20:07.760 --> 20:13.520
happening at you know for whatever reason unbeknownst to me i i guess there was a bounty for the first

20:13.520 --> 20:19.120
person who would find the rest of the chapters uh the professor latent games and

20:19.120 --> 20:24.160
guy hits me up he's like hey you got fifteen hundred dollars to your name and i'm like i'm

20:24.160 --> 20:30.480
sorry what that's like hey he's like here's fifteen hundred dollars and i was like yeah that's crazy

20:30.480 --> 20:36.640
first off why you have a bounty for that but i mean loyal fans what can we say i'm sure somebody

20:36.640 --> 20:42.560
would be willing to put up a bounty for before crisis or something right but latent fans um

20:43.360 --> 20:48.400
so yeah i met a bounty and then i just didn't feel right for just what i do is just i bought a

20:48.400 --> 20:55.520
lot of phones i just happened to find it uh so sure most people know but we ended up donating that

20:55.520 --> 21:00.800
money out to hit save uh just because it made more sense uh for it to go somewhere and be used

21:00.800 --> 21:05.920
besides me just sitting on it and not really needing the money because we're already spending our

21:05.920 --> 21:11.520
own money to buy these lots so at the end of the day if uh if it goes somewhere else and gets used better

21:11.520 --> 21:17.120
so it's a better cause it's really really appreciated so i wanted to thank you in person

21:17.120 --> 21:22.800
as well so thank you no worries no worries but yeah that's kind of the story of that phone i mean

21:22.800 --> 21:28.240
and i don't remember who it was but there was one person in the discord that kind of said oh it looks

21:28.240 --> 21:32.880
like a house fire like it survived a house fire or something like that and somehow every new story

21:32.880 --> 21:38.320
just kind of picked up on that of that case because i think cosmo uh had put in his uh his uh

21:38.320 --> 21:43.920
ex post of the saying look like it survived a house fire and therefore everybody kind of went

21:43.920 --> 21:49.360
off on that and so it's now deemed the house fire phone so we'll never forget it

21:52.160 --> 21:58.560
that's awesome now i will say that i think it is quite obvious uh i think most of us honestly we

21:58.560 --> 22:04.080
look for these type of phones uh because somehow they always end up giving us the best things uh

22:04.080 --> 22:08.160
they went through a hard life and somehow if they went through a hard life they normally have some

22:08.160 --> 22:12.560
goods on them and that's kind of panned out to be honest i feel like every time i've seen a phone that

22:12.560 --> 22:18.960
snapped in half they sometimes have something on them a lot of reason for that is because

22:18.960 --> 22:27.680
if the phone is broken it's difficult to initialize the data yeah yeah like you can't just wipe it so

22:27.680 --> 22:33.440
that's uh that yeah that's true yeah that makes a lot of sense

22:36.240 --> 22:40.320
so with all these games and the data that you preserve from these phones

22:42.160 --> 22:48.000
stephanie you're working on a project to actually be able to play these games not on the phones but

22:48.000 --> 22:56.000
on a computer so can you tell us a bit about squirrel jme and how it works and and the work you've

22:56.000 --> 23:05.280
been doing in the past year yeah so squirrel jme is a java me 8 virtual machine which basically

23:06.800 --> 23:14.080
there's your desktop java and java me is basically a subset of that so much smaller for embedded

23:14.080 --> 23:22.800
devices like phones iot devices you know like fridges and stuff like that and basically these

23:22.800 --> 23:27.600
phones are kind of just like the extension of that like what could run on like a fridge

23:27.600 --> 23:39.760
or something like that right so pretty much from that the things that i've been doing is that

23:41.440 --> 23:49.440
a lot of the times with these older games is that they're made for older phones and devices

23:49.440 --> 24:00.960
right and there's a lot of assumptions about kind of like how the processor acts and so i mean not to

24:00.960 --> 24:09.760
kind of complicate things but basically we've advanced in cpu technology so you have like

24:10.560 --> 24:17.840
16 core cpus now with hyper threading and stuff like that you know super duper gpus

24:18.800 --> 24:26.320
and the thing is these phones back then one thing is that they just have one single cpu

24:27.280 --> 24:35.440
just executing everything you know just next to each other right code wise

24:36.320 --> 24:43.200
and one of the big issues with that is that because of the advances in technology

24:44.000 --> 24:53.120
that a lot of this older software runs differently if you were to run it today on modern cpus and modern jvms

24:54.000 --> 25:01.920
because everything's just kind of like a moving target so my goal with squirrel jamie is essentially

25:01.920 --> 25:12.720
to have kind of like a snapshot of sorts so that you can like experience these games right and

25:12.720 --> 25:24.320
essentially just be able to play them for example so with regards to that uh there's for example the megaman

25:24.320 --> 25:36.640
games and then there's also like tetris game i believe as well where essentially it will just break if you try

25:36.640 --> 25:44.720
running it on kind of like an environment that it wasn't made for it just won't run properly

25:46.240 --> 25:53.120
and for squirrel jamie i kind of like force it into that box to where

25:53.120 --> 26:03.280
where it's closer to how things were back in the early 2000s in the mid 2000s and that like increases

26:03.280 --> 26:10.240
compatibility with the software and that's a lot of the stuff that i've been doing in the past year

26:10.240 --> 26:15.280
is uh pretty much kind of like that

26:18.080 --> 26:22.080
you know very hard integration

26:24.720 --> 26:34.000
so i know in previous podcasts we've been we've talked about the um sdk i believe it was i can't

26:34.000 --> 26:39.920
remember what it was exactly but yes exactly the sdk emulator so this is

26:39.920 --> 26:47.680
the um uh what you're creating here is something that is way more robust way more performant

26:48.240 --> 26:57.680
yeah and yeah just available for more people yeah basically uh you'll be able to at some point

26:57.680 --> 27:04.080
you know use a game pad with things and play with it because the sdk is just it's made for developers

27:05.040 --> 27:10.000
it was never intended to be used you know to actually play the games

27:11.840 --> 27:22.000
and you know i am hoping to get like better audio support more performant audio support and kind of just

27:22.000 --> 27:31.280
like making it a much better experience of course you know that stuff takes time so i'm hoping this year

27:31.280 --> 27:40.320
i can get something which it'll be interesting um you can actually sort of do things now with the

27:40.320 --> 27:47.680
standalone version which does actually kind of run stuff so that's pretty neat so that's a call to

27:47.680 --> 27:56.960
action to any java developers who love to work on audio to come and help out yeah basically

27:57.680 --> 28:06.720
if there's any audio so of course audio is not like the priority right now so that'd be a little

28:06.720 --> 28:12.640
bit more later on because right now the priority is kind of just getting the more important bits if that makes

28:12.640 --> 28:23.760
sense so that's great um i see here in our podcast notes as well something about nano coat

28:23.760 --> 28:30.800
you want to talk about that yeah so nano coat is the virtual machine i'm working on that is written in c

28:30.800 --> 28:39.680
and that would be running on retro arc for example and that would be running on say you know your phone

28:41.120 --> 28:48.880
or your desktop or maybe even like the ps2 your 3ds because uh retro arc is kind of like on everything

28:50.160 --> 28:56.560
so i am part of retro arc team you know it's mostly just volunteers for the most part

28:57.520 --> 29:05.840
but it's basically the native port and it's kind of like so i have spring code which is written in java

29:05.840 --> 29:12.960
and that's kind of like the baseline virtual machine that i wrote initially you know completely

29:12.960 --> 29:21.520
in java and now i'm working on a native c1 that'll be more portable and cross-platform to where

29:21.520 --> 29:29.360
you don't need a host virtual machine to actually run the virtual machine so essentially you know you

29:29.360 --> 29:37.680
can run it on a 3ds or your desktop or your phone and then you won't need to have this very huge

29:38.320 --> 29:47.600
cumbersome java installation just to be able to play the software and the thing with the sdk emulator is

29:47.600 --> 29:54.080
that you also have to have that you know cumbersome desktop java to be able to run stuff

29:55.840 --> 30:06.320
so essentially nano code you know nano being small and it's essentially just going to be a leaner virtual

30:06.320 --> 30:15.680
machine so this is going to be a very user-friendly method of being able to play these games going forward

30:15.680 --> 30:24.320
yeah or that's the goal at least yeah that's the goal and if you're using like the uh retroarch front

30:24.320 --> 30:33.760
end then uh there'll be of course like controller support and then i'll have to figure out like

30:33.760 --> 30:42.240
save states and stuff like that which will be interesting because java itself doesn't really

30:42.240 --> 30:52.880
lend itself to such things but i think i can make that work uh that i am very very excited to see

30:53.760 --> 31:00.720
how you progress with this because that would make it um a lot easier for for people to actually try

31:00.720 --> 31:08.640
these out the games that you have preserved and um yeah make make some deep dive videos on them and

31:08.640 --> 31:18.400
enjoy them yeah but it does involve lots of uh research yeah but like most of the time

31:20.320 --> 31:26.240
my time is spent just like researching and then developing and then also refactoring because

31:27.200 --> 31:36.240
because this is such a big complex project you know it's the you have like the 95 of projects

31:36.240 --> 31:43.920
this is like the five percent of projects where no other project kind of how you would do that applies

31:44.400 --> 31:49.120
so everything has to be done differently and i know

31:51.120 --> 31:55.920
i've said that you know squirrel jamie would be out like last year this year but the thing is

31:56.720 --> 32:02.880
you know i do work but also as well there is a lot of research and making sure that everything's done

32:02.880 --> 32:10.960
right the first time right the first time you know so that way it's easy when things get broke they're

32:10.960 --> 32:22.240
easy to fix which you know they are thankfully yeah so and also as well um to kind of get like that

32:22.240 --> 32:32.240
kind of experience where it doesn't like frustrate you to use it if that makes sense

32:35.040 --> 32:41.600
yeah yeah i think that makes a lot of sense and i i love that you're working with the retro art team

32:41.600 --> 32:47.840
and trying to make it more user friendly but i absolutely understand there's a lot of research going

32:48.640 --> 32:57.520
going into this project and you do have a day job as well yeah which is uh working on medical devices so

32:58.960 --> 33:06.480
very different very different yeah and also pretty important so and uh

33:06.480 --> 33:17.840
uh sometimes i get off work and you know i'm kind of tired so totally get that yeah but thanks have

33:17.840 --> 33:26.640
been going well that's awesome so what have been the the most fun thing that you have done in squirrel jamie

33:26.640 --> 33:38.480
um lately um most thing the thing that you think either a quirky thing that you finally figured out

33:38.480 --> 33:46.400
or something that made it run better or something like that um there's actually something silly

33:46.400 --> 33:57.840
uh it turns out that i had well if you knew java bytecode there is an instruction called table switch

33:59.360 --> 34:00.480
which is basically

34:02.960 --> 34:10.800
a jump table of one two three four five so say like if one go to this address if two go to this address

34:10.800 --> 34:22.480
etc right and uh that was implemented incorrectly um i was running some dojo software which ended up crashing

34:22.480 --> 34:31.040
uh because uh i was running it in spring coat which is very uh pedantic about everything right

34:32.160 --> 34:36.560
which that's the purpose of it so this one dojo software kind of just

34:38.160 --> 34:43.520
broke and then it's just like oh i implemented it wrong

34:43.520 --> 34:52.320
oops oops that's great that's great to find though um yeah and it's just like it worked

34:53.200 --> 35:01.120
for five years without issues and just this one random dojo software just breaks it

35:02.560 --> 35:06.400
that's funny it's it's hilarious i love that

35:06.400 --> 35:21.360
so yeah it's just like uh kind of like checking all this dojo software is kind of just like

35:22.160 --> 35:31.040
interesting and kind of just has improved squirrel jamie in general so and this also helps out you know

35:31.040 --> 35:39.680
western software as well like the mid p games because it just you know it's more surface area for testing

35:41.840 --> 35:47.440
and i guess probably one of the most important things is like testing and making sure things work

35:49.120 --> 35:55.040
yeah yeah for sure i mean you can you can implement things but if they don't work they don't

35:55.040 --> 36:00.720
work so yeah testing is really important yeah and implementation wise i do kind of

36:01.040 --> 36:10.560
uh fail fast which is a programming term to where when you encounter a failure state or an unknown or

36:10.560 --> 36:19.120
undefined state then the program terminates so essentially that means

36:20.880 --> 36:27.840
squirrel jamie when it knows it's about to enter an unknown program state then it'll just terminate right

36:27.840 --> 36:39.440
there rather than continuing which makes things easier to buck to debug easier to implement because i know exactly where that happened and

36:42.560 --> 36:44.240
that has kind of just like

36:47.120 --> 36:54.160
made things so much easier than doing stuff like game specific hacks and stuff like that

36:54.160 --> 37:04.240
that which is uh you know untenable when you have thousands and thousands of titles yeah yeah you want to

37:05.520 --> 37:09.840
you want to focus on what what gets most of them over the finish line there yeah pretty much

37:11.440 --> 37:18.560
this is awesome so um squirrel jamie where we at hit save we're super happy to

37:18.560 --> 37:27.120
uh help with some of the funding for the the development here so i'm super happy to hear about all the yeah and

37:27.120 --> 37:35.920
thank you so much progress here it's it's super fun we we love open source projects and yeah we we of course utilize

37:35.920 --> 37:41.840
a ton of open source projects ourselves as well so seeing the progress here is fantastic so thank you so much

37:41.840 --> 37:50.160
and the funding's been put to good use it's uh being used for the cicd which is basically just

37:50.880 --> 37:56.640
constantly building and then testing squirrel jamie with all the tests i wrote you know to make sure

37:56.640 --> 38:05.040
things don't just break out of nowhere and that's been making sure that you know things continue to

38:05.040 --> 38:15.360
progress well not break and it's actually kind of difficult because even though i'm an open source

38:15.360 --> 38:28.400
project you know run by a single person i kind of appear to be like a large i mean it is a large project but

38:28.400 --> 38:39.200
like resource and usage wise it's very rare for a project you know as mentioned previously

38:40.000 --> 38:48.000
and it's kind of hard to actually find companies that are actually even willing to even help out

38:49.120 --> 38:57.680
you know so i'm really glad that you at hit save have helped out so really helps

38:58.400 --> 39:05.600
yeah we we love it and so so thank you again thank you i wanted to uh dive into

39:07.280 --> 39:16.480
the tetris dj game ellen if you're uh if you can explain this a bit i i because it doesn't make sense

39:16.480 --> 39:23.840
to me in my head how does a tetris rhythm game work okay so there are a few things to mention about

39:23.840 --> 39:31.360
the game the way that it was found was actually kind of incredible but also not incredible basically

39:31.360 --> 39:36.960
i was just looking i took the debug cable i plugged it into every single phone i had

39:37.600 --> 39:43.280
this one phone lit up which i did not expect because it was a casio phone and usually only the

39:43.280 --> 39:52.080
nec and panasonic phones light out and light up turns out casio casio phones were made by nec

39:52.080 --> 39:59.440
in the later years so it was actually just an nec phone i could not open it so i extracted the data

39:59.440 --> 40:07.600
like it was an nec phone and it had tetris dj uh what is tetris dj tetris dj uh is a game

40:08.400 --> 40:14.560
that includes a dj mode so you can play regular tetris in it as well in the dj mode the goal is to

40:14.560 --> 40:20.720
drop the pieces on the beat and if you drop the pieces on the beat you get extra points

40:22.480 --> 40:30.400
that's basically it you can kind of emulate this in um the uh softbank proprietary mexa emulator

40:30.400 --> 40:38.800
however there is a good deal of lag that makes it a bit tricky to play

40:41.200 --> 40:42.560
maybe i could try running it

40:44.720 --> 40:50.960
that could be interesting because uh the softbank games though those aren't doja they're actually

40:50.960 --> 40:59.280
closer to mid p and there are already some other emulation projects that can run

40:59.920 --> 41:08.000
a few of the games from softbank the only problem is they can't emulate the audio so tetris dj with no

41:08.000 --> 41:15.520
audio is a lot less fun i bet just uh make up the music in your head

41:17.920 --> 41:23.200
have a game boy next to you maybe uh play some tetris tunes yeah

41:23.200 --> 41:34.080
so i wanted to dive into before crisis because that's a game that has been talked about in

41:34.080 --> 41:44.080
multiple of these podcasts and uv you have been um a star here essentially making sure that that was

41:44.080 --> 41:47.840
preserved properly and you also have some um

41:47.840 --> 41:55.920
uh you've had some challenges preserving some server-based imode games um which obviously

41:55.920 --> 41:59.200
before crisis comes in there so can you tell us a bit about that

41:59.200 --> 42:05.840
yeah so uh i mean what isn't there not to say about before crisis i think

42:07.200 --> 42:12.560
is it probably the most recognizable imode game probably it's probably the true statement i would

42:12.560 --> 42:19.280
say so yes um before crisis is one of those games that everybody kind of knows about everybody wants

42:19.280 --> 42:25.120
to play uh kind of almost to the vein of xeno saga but just not with the final fantasy name attached to

42:25.120 --> 42:32.560
it is uh thanks to naya as we spoke earlier that he was able to find a copy from us so you see that

42:33.120 --> 42:37.840
we even have the ability of uh looking at the game today or even trying to preserve it

42:38.720 --> 42:45.920
um and that's honestly kind of where my story starts um this is kind of how i came into working on this

42:45.920 --> 42:52.640
is really that uh now you have preserved them and i just so happened to get uh recommended

42:52.640 --> 42:59.920
um something from cosmo uh a post he made that hey we preserved all these amazing square enix games

42:59.920 --> 43:05.760
but the one that everybody wants is uh before crisis just doesn't boot doesn't run you know

43:05.760 --> 43:13.520
it has a lot of issues inside of the sdk emulator today and so um correct me if i'm wrong but i think prior

43:13.520 --> 43:21.040
to uh before crisis uh nobody on the team has really tried to work on reviving any of the server

43:21.040 --> 43:29.600
mode games or server reliant games um there so i think that's the case yeah that was the case

43:29.600 --> 43:38.400
yeah 100 it is and so yeah i mean not to say that it's my forte but i mean i've been doing

43:38.400 --> 43:44.720
fan translations and reverse engineering for roughly like a decade now and uh one of my ultimate goals

43:44.720 --> 43:50.720
at the end of the day has always been to bring back a certain uh mmo called tales of attorney online

43:50.720 --> 43:57.600
and so i've dabbled uh quite a lot into reverse engineering network protocols and um honestly

43:57.600 --> 44:03.840
i i wanted an easier project uh for something to work on because working on mmo is kind of a next

44:03.840 --> 44:11.120
level reverse engineering project and that's kind of where these not simple but more simplistic uh

44:11.120 --> 44:18.320
mobile online reliant games come into place um so the first story with uh before crisis really

44:18.320 --> 44:22.960
started with uh us just trying to get the game to boot because the second you even boot the game it

44:22.960 --> 44:28.240
automatically goes in and and tries to make a bunch of network requests and start downloading data of

44:28.240 --> 44:34.720
that nature and so um really trying to figure out first off uh what data it's requesting uh what type

44:34.720 --> 44:41.440
of data is even trying to download and so um what ends up being is that just uh to start off the game

44:41.440 --> 44:47.280
there's roughly like five to eight packets depending if that's a new uh new register person or a saved

44:47.280 --> 44:52.960
game um that it will go through to some authentication checks make sure you have enough money to play the

44:52.960 --> 44:59.600
game they'll start downloading some files um that are kind of like the main menu files that it needs to be

44:59.600 --> 45:07.600
able to load the menu uh then it will get your saved data which that saved data is all encrypted as well

45:07.600 --> 45:12.560
uh and so trying to figure out everything that this game did was just kind of a mess at first

45:14.000 --> 45:22.080
one of the beauties of working on this though is thankfully that um we sometimes get lucky that the

45:22.080 --> 45:28.160
games we reverse engineer for the k-type games they're not obfuscated and what that means is that

45:28.160 --> 45:33.520
we can get in and look at the code and we have the original naming scheme of every function and that they

45:33.520 --> 45:38.720
use to make these games and thankfully before crisis is one of those games where it was not

45:39.840 --> 45:45.200
obfuscated in any ways that significantly speeds up the process of knowing what function is doing

45:45.200 --> 45:51.040
what so if they name a function and it says download save well i know that function is downloading the

45:51.040 --> 45:56.880
save data right so other games they'll be obfuscated where they'll just be a single letter character

45:56.880 --> 46:02.320
called a capital a lowercase a capital b capital b or something like that right and so

46:02.320 --> 46:08.800
now you have no idea what these do until you really dig deep to figure it out but uh four

46:08.800 --> 46:15.920
crisis was nice to us in that ways so i think it was literally maybe only like a day or two it took

46:15.920 --> 46:21.760
me to get to the main menu of the game took a bunch of figuring out how the file system worked in that

46:21.760 --> 46:29.040
game which i know stephanie kind of spoke on regarding uh the sps before real briefly before

46:29.040 --> 46:37.920
crisis does the same thing it chunks up the sp and stores certain types of data in the sp for example

46:37.920 --> 46:43.680
the first slot of that sp is always the main menu data and it will never change it will always be

46:43.680 --> 46:49.200
that thankfully unless there's a new version of that main menu data it'll always be that but as you go

46:49.200 --> 46:54.240
down through the chunks that were allocated you find out that some chunks were reused for multiple

46:54.240 --> 47:00.800
purposes like we have chunks that are for maps we have chunks that are for uh media we have chunks

47:00.800 --> 47:07.680
that are for uh music things of that nature and so those constantly get overwritten deleted reused and

47:07.680 --> 47:13.440
so we only have a limited amount of data that we actually get out of before crisis specifically

47:14.320 --> 47:19.120
so thankfully we were lucky enough obviously to have an sp that had some data in it

47:19.680 --> 47:25.600
so we have the main menu data which allowed me to finally get past a bunch of the network requirements

47:25.600 --> 47:31.520
and get the game actually booting into the main menu um once figured that out we're able to realize

47:31.520 --> 47:37.760
okay what data do we have today because that was the next problem is what data do we have once we

47:37.760 --> 47:44.160
figured out what type of data we actually have um in the sp we were then able to realize okay

47:44.160 --> 47:50.880
okay the last person or the last person who played this game they stopped at um the reno training

47:50.880 --> 47:56.160
mission so they played the reno training mission and that was the last thing they ever did on that

47:56.160 --> 48:03.440
game therefore that is the only thing we are able to get working today uh inside of before crisis and so

48:04.160 --> 48:11.360
this is now the story of before crisis is there are roughly three to four hundred different types of

48:11.360 --> 48:18.640
files based off of my estimates that this game needs actually have a full operating game um

48:19.680 --> 48:26.400
unfortunately that means we need roughly three to four hundred phones worth of data and that's not

48:26.400 --> 48:33.840
accounting for the fact that we are bound to get duplicates of the same data right and so this is kind of

48:33.840 --> 48:40.000
where we are now trying to piece together things and trying to create our own things and that's kind of where

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
i've um built a lot of tools to mitigate some of these issues knowing that we're never going to be able to

48:46.000 --> 48:52.240
make this happen um so again we originally started off with only having the reno training mission

48:53.120 --> 48:59.520
and from there i worked with nalia to kind of figure out um he was able to give me some ideas like hey

48:59.520 --> 49:07.360
back in the day um the beta version of this game they had a map in the shimmer hq that they actually used for the

49:07.360 --> 49:12.720
the battle area and i was like okay that's cool he was able to provide me some tile sets for that and

49:12.720 --> 49:19.360
i was able to fully reverse engineer how the map files work in this game um that's on a byte to

49:19.360 --> 49:27.520
byte level so hex right and so with that knowledge i can now build our own file or game compatible map

49:27.520 --> 49:34.080
files for before crisis and theoretically i can build any map it i could put you on mars or whatever and i

49:34.080 --> 49:39.200
i could put you in there and it would just load it because they think that's an original um you know

49:40.000 --> 49:46.640
before crisis file at this point because i'm the one that created it pipe for pipe perfect so yeah you're

49:46.640 --> 49:55.280
not just preserving the game you're you're be you're able to mod it um essentially yeah i mean pretty

49:55.280 --> 50:01.520
much that's exactly uh what i ended up having to do is uh not only just for that we now have the ability

50:01.520 --> 50:08.720
of making our own uh material files as well so the material files um real simply they're just a bunch

50:08.720 --> 50:14.800
of animation data with images attached to them and so um really it's just figuring out how did the

50:14.800 --> 50:20.720
animation system work and once we kind of figure that out we can now make those and so the whole

50:20.720 --> 50:27.120
purpose around this again wasn't that we want to mod the game it's simply that we just i knew there's no

50:27.120 --> 50:31.920
way we're ever going to get all this data to make this a real game and so with the more dumps we get

50:31.920 --> 50:38.080
of the game it helps me understand more about the file system structure and bite-to-bite stuff of how

50:38.080 --> 50:44.720
these individual files work which allows me to replicate these a lot better because we have source

50:44.720 --> 50:50.320
material well we have pictures and videos of other stuff of the game that's been documented out there

50:50.320 --> 50:56.640
that we can pull images from or something of that nature to then be able to inject them into the game

50:56.640 --> 51:03.360
today and um you know we've already had majority of the text already translated into english at this

51:03.360 --> 51:08.640
point as well so once we're ready uh for that we'll make sure everybody's able to play the game

51:08.640 --> 51:16.240
because that's obviously the next step is ensuring um all the text can be done um let's see after that

51:16.240 --> 51:22.800
um we had made some quick discoveries that um there are two extra apps with before crisis that come

51:22.800 --> 51:30.240
with it one we call uh extra or really it's the weapon d mode which is a completely separate like

51:31.120 --> 51:36.880
multiplayer style mode that was made in this game kind of almost like your pokemon go style where

51:36.880 --> 51:40.480
you would travel the world and based off depending where you were at it would kind of give you a

51:40.480 --> 51:46.080
different um was it like a different like enemies that would show up for you to attack or something

51:46.080 --> 51:50.960
like that in that mode and that would all change the story that happens in that mode in particular

51:52.000 --> 52:00.000
and then we also have um the golden saucer app as well which of course is famously just a bunch of

52:00.000 --> 52:06.960
mini games uh related to final fantasy 7 so the boxing the snow boring um what are the ones that

52:06.960 --> 52:13.520
have in there uh trogo racing as well of course so all that stuff's kind of in there and so as we

52:13.520 --> 52:19.440
dug through those apps and i had to again figure out uh the network protocols reverse engineer how

52:19.440 --> 52:25.360
they even got all their data in there how they're all sent uh and we're able to find out that hey we

52:25.360 --> 52:32.480
do have some data um for this as well so we're able to bring back the arm wrestling mini game for

52:32.480 --> 52:38.160
the golden saucer so that's fully functional as well and we even have the cross app launching working

52:38.160 --> 52:43.920
correctly now which is amazing so you can load into the game completely just like you originally would

52:43.920 --> 52:48.480
you can go into the golden saucer app or it was launched the golden saucer app actually and then

52:48.480 --> 52:52.800
you'd be able to go into the mini game play it it would save your data just like you were just playing

52:52.800 --> 52:59.200
the game would update how many uh what your high score was put on leaderboards things of that nature so

52:59.200 --> 53:05.440
all that stuff's working um golden saucer apps not too bad i think we need probably about 20 files

53:05.440 --> 53:11.680
for that to actually be fully complete um roughly and then weapon d mode is going to be another chunk

53:11.680 --> 53:17.440
of data that we probably will never get because that is a mode that is actually highly undocumented

53:18.000 --> 53:22.480
uh again since that's kind of more of a an asymmetrical multiplayer mode as well so

53:22.480 --> 53:30.560
yeah exactly yeah i mean it's like the if i remember correctly the weapon d mode you had

53:30.560 --> 53:38.000
mentioned it depends on your location right so it's like if you're in for example hokkaido which is

53:38.000 --> 53:45.680
all the way up north in japan you will correspond to like icicle in in like the actual like in-game

53:45.680 --> 53:51.200
ff7 world you know so like there are there are some things corresponding there and i guess

53:51.200 --> 53:57.520
other detail i wanted to add was the whole cross app launching thing um if you remember earlier i had

53:57.520 --> 54:03.920
mentioned oi katamari damasi-kun um that that's interesting spinoff of that 2d credits mini game

54:03.920 --> 54:09.360
and that i think was the first uh game that we had preserved that had that functionality so basically

54:09.360 --> 54:14.400
you would have that main application and then if you wanted to access those uh those extra levels it

54:14.400 --> 54:19.440
would launch its own app and the app had a different name and that app would have like i don't know 10

54:19.440 --> 54:24.800
different levels and you would and you would go into that so correct me if i'm wrong uv but i think that

54:24.800 --> 54:29.520
game might have helped you i think i guess restore that kind of cross app thing because at least you

54:29.520 --> 54:37.920
have an example now to work off of yeah in some ways what ended up being is that the doja sdk that we

54:37.920 --> 54:43.840
particularly use today um the way it operates and some of the calls are a little bit different from when

54:43.840 --> 54:49.360
they're natively on a phone so we just had to modify them so they would work and yeah uh katamari

54:49.360 --> 54:52.080
katamari damasi was kind of the one that pointed that out to us

54:54.800 --> 55:00.400
so i think that's kind of primarily the journey of before crisis day kind of really summed up i mean

55:00.400 --> 55:05.120
it's kind of been the game we've all been wanting to work on and you know i talk about it how

55:05.680 --> 55:10.560
hey we have this game working people can kind of play it in some way but um it is still

55:10.560 --> 55:16.640
we don't have it publicly available for people to actually currently play on the server and that

55:16.640 --> 55:21.920
really comes down to a couple things which is if i make it publicly available it's great because at

55:21.920 --> 55:28.000
least people can go see what there is um what little of there is but really it's simply the matter of the

55:28.000 --> 55:32.880
fact that we want at least when i've talked about we want something substantial to bring out and let

55:32.880 --> 55:41.520
people do more so than just a single mission right and so this is um where the w51h uh copy of the game

55:41.520 --> 55:49.760
came in which is from a completely different platform um which is brew so different than doja and the

55:49.760 --> 55:56.640
way that game had worked is uh slightly different in the matter of fact that the brew platform from

55:56.640 --> 56:02.720
my understanding doesn't have any limitations in terms of file systems uh file storage space so

56:02.880 --> 56:08.320
it kind of just stored things more uncompressed and actually things look better because they're not

56:08.320 --> 56:14.240
using gifs they're actually using uh bmps so they're actually a better image format and the files

56:14.240 --> 56:21.360
are all structurally the same but also not the same because when you look at the network side of this

56:21.360 --> 56:26.960
game it always sends out two different type of network calls one of them i call a common network call

56:26.960 --> 56:33.280
and one of them might call a phone specific network call so the game is very aware of what type of phone

56:33.280 --> 56:40.160
you are using at all given times and it will only request data for that specific phone so what that

56:40.160 --> 56:46.720
means is that there are certain file types that are cross-compatible against all phone types regardless

56:46.720 --> 56:54.880
if they're brew um easy web or kddi or even doja or yahoo for even i think there's a yahoo version

56:55.440 --> 57:01.760
um and then there is the phone specific ones where again those files are only meant for certain

57:01.760 --> 57:10.160
types of phones so the w51h um has both right so in the what it doesn't have an sp but in the file

57:10.160 --> 57:16.400
system structure itself there are common files and there are the phone specific files the common files

57:16.400 --> 57:21.120
are great i can drag and drop them into the current system they work and load just like we normally

57:21.120 --> 57:26.560
would want them to but when it comes to the phone specific ones which are the ones that really

57:26.560 --> 57:35.280
matters those are like our character images are a scenario data and our um character data so that's

57:35.280 --> 57:41.200
going to be um how many characters are on their screen with the sprites their data like how much hp

57:41.200 --> 57:47.440
they have attack power things of that nature right so all of these are more phone specific type because

57:47.440 --> 57:55.920
they're different image formats is primarily what it comes down to and so knowing we now had the full

57:55.920 --> 58:03.680
chapter one my job was to find a way to convert all of those files to work on doja because that is

58:03.680 --> 58:10.720
the server system that we have working today and the best sdk with audio support that works today as well

58:12.000 --> 58:18.400
now i would like to say i was fully successful with that but unfortunately i'm not um we are still

58:18.400 --> 58:25.920
at a standstill with that i was primarily able to get let's say 80 of them converted with a lot of them

58:25.920 --> 58:32.800
working today for example the fire material spell is a phone specific thing but i was able to convert

58:32.800 --> 58:39.680
all of those files um that are inside of this proprietary file to work with the doja so what

58:39.680 --> 58:45.040
that means is we now have the fire material which sounds crazy but again we now have one of the three

58:45.040 --> 58:52.720
basic materials uh available now in the game so that gives us roughly four materials we now have access to

58:52.720 --> 59:02.480
um that work but the biggest thing holding us back now is the bruise way of handling audio files

59:03.200 --> 59:09.680
the audio files are handled completely different uh versus doja and unfortunately what that means is that

59:10.320 --> 59:19.120
um even with me trying to what i like to say fake the data the game will still refuse to load any

59:19.120 --> 59:28.800
um data regarding the scenario because it does not have the appropriate audio files in place and what

59:28.800 --> 59:34.880
that just ends up happening is that the game just will refuse to work even though i've converted everything

59:34.880 --> 59:41.120
inside of there we just simply do not have a method today to convert the audio formats between the two

59:41.120 --> 59:48.160
so i've reached out to a couple people uh that are way more familiar with audio stuff than i am and

59:48.160 --> 59:52.800
they're working on something so potentially maybe in the future we'll have a way of making this work

59:52.800 --> 59:59.760
but as of right now the only way still today to play um final fantasy before crisis is the

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:06.960
emulator with no body support but it's getting there um so hopefully maybe by the i would like to say

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.840
by the end of the year that we'll definitely have uh the server available so at least people can play

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.880
chapter one or the prologue uh before crisis

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.720
this is really impressive work i mean not just reverse engineering the phones but reverse

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:30.080
engineering how it talks over the networks and and what's what the game is expecting to get back and

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:40.960
um reverse engineering how the game runs and uh also being able to uh modify it like you talked about

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:47.440
the maps you were able to recreate maps and you could create your own maps as well this is just fantastic

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.200
work yeah i appreciate it uh you know it's definitely been a team effort right i like to say everything's

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:59.680
me but um obviously now yeah there's he's the he is the well of knowledge when it comes to that game

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.960
and i know he has probably 10x the passion i do for that game even though mine is pretty high as well

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.360
uh so if there's ever any information i need or it's like there's some weird tidbits of stuff that i have

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:19.680
to do i can ask him and he provides it to me uh case in point is you never guess but most of the text

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.720
for that game comes from the server it's not stored locally so i have to ask now yeah to go hunt uh and

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.440
give me all the text that he finds from the videos or whatever that he gets from his sources and

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:40.320
really shout outs also to the gentleman who provided us the dump because he had also provided us a

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:47.360
lot of great videos uh that i don't think anybody's ever seen of that game that helped us uh bring in

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.440
knowledge of knowing how the game even works um like i never played the game so i don't know what

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.800
happens when i click this button right what happens after that and so if i know what happens i know what

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.520
i need to give the game right but if i don't know it really makes it my job harder and so having that

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.320
footage really uh speeds things up and so yeah it's been a great work um i mean real briefly i know i'm

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.040
the server guy but uh i work on a lot of other servers for stuff as well i know we kind of

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.720
mentioned final phase seven snowboarding leaderboards uh brought that back as well there's megaman

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:30.480
x1 leaderboards now if i recall at that point uh even the kingdom hearts side games i'll call them

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.920
so not the coded um all the avatar kingdom mini games all have their leaderboards in function as well at

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:44.320
this point um and then i think my biggest next one was uh sd gundam uh generations which is quite a

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.360
complex game that we were able to get reverse engineering working but again created a full

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.200
server for that game as well uh and now that one's fully preserved 100 functional and playable today

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:05.360
that's amazing and do you think you would be this far if the code had been obfuscated

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:17.440
uh probably not but i will tell you i worked on many games now at this point that you know i'll say 75

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.680
75 of the games i work on are probably obfuscated now but i've come in just such a way of finding the

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:30.160
stuff the functions the data the the code that i need to find it really doesn't bother me as much

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.800
as it did at first once you've looked at the code you kind of realize how a lot of these games work

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.480
you kind of now figured a lot of it out you can kind of just assume this is how it works and you

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.560
can find it really quickly so i think sd gundam was completely obfuscated if i recall and i was able

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:55.440
to make that one work um and i believe uh megamen x1 was as well but a lot of the square enix games

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:04.320
are not obfuscated um i think the biggest offender of that if i recall is konami or their games no i

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:13.120
lied it's namco it's namco is a problem yes because it was uh even the tales games i was looking at

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.640
recently which uh a big thing of mine uh they're all obfuscated and just trying to figure out how to

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.680
even get past the authentication checks in those games can be super complex um unfortunately but yeah

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:37.040
yeah um to the uh obfuscation point um i'm kind of like java bytecode and stuff like that is kind of like

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:46.400
natural to me so there have been a few times where uv has come to me like hey what does this do i'm just

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.680
like oh it does this this this and this is the input this is the output and it's like oh well

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:01.360
yeah i should mention i really never worked in java prior to working on katai stuff i'm not a java guy

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.720
i'm primarily a dotnet person but coding is coding at the end of the day and you kind of understand it

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:12.480
kind of quickly once you've seen code yeah um and so i was able to catch up pretty fast but yeah i

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:19.120
definitely still rely upon uh 70 here sometimes for some issues that i have yeah especially around like

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.040
some of the puzzles because i know yeah there is one you had me look at and it was like

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:35.360
i think it was cold stuff saga that one was a pain yeah it was like 400 lines in a single method and

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.840
it had like 100 switch cases or something like all these branches inside

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:53.200
and uh it was like if there was zero zero and zero zero zero zero yeah i think that was the one that you

01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:00.160
said yeah there's a lot of servers that i've worked on that are not fully released as of yet because either

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:06.960
i've worked on them and then found out um we don't have data to make them work which is 99 of the case

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.680
you know it ends up being just unfortunately that when you want to play the game the game immediately

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:19.280
requests data that we no longer have and um tails is kind of a great point um we have data on the sp

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:26.160
the scratch pad for it to work but immediately when you boot up the game it wants the main menu data

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:33.120
and unfortunately the main menu data is overwritten um so whenever the last person who played this game

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.240
they didn't go back to the main menu when they quit the game they just exited a hard exit at the game

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:44.960
which saved all the data from when they were in the middle of the game so unfortunately we lose that

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.040
main menu data which means we can't even get into some of these games or even play them which is

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:54.160
why i have probably like 30 different servers that just sit vacant doing nothing for now

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:03.440
nothing yet yeah nothing yet exactly exactly we got a couple games on the horizon i'm hoping i can

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.880
resurrect some servers for uh kingdom hearts code is one of them that i have a partially working server

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:15.120
for just simply need the sd card data for that uh and then some other nice ones coming out eventually so

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:26.800
fantastic again fantastic work appreciate it um so i wanted to uh as we were talking about reverse

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:34.560
engineering and looking into things ellen you have some interesting stories about reverse engineering

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.760
the phones and dumping the chips and and doing all kinds of things

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:50.080
yes so uh this year or at the end of last year i managed to successfully recruit one of my friends

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.960
to the project it's someone who had actually been hearing about the project from me for a while but

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:02.160
at one point i opened up a phone that happens to have an adapter a chip adapter already made to be used

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.120
in a regular chip reader and i asked if you could help me with that because i'm not really the best at

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.440
soldering once he saw what we did with that phone he thought maybe i can do this with more phones and

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:20.720
so it grew and it grew and it grew the process of dumping the phone chips though is is complicated

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:29.440
and not just technically difficult but also physically difficult so for the phones that we cannot exploit

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:38.080
through a usb it's necessary to find the chip on the phone that contains the data and remove it now

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:46.720
these are bgas bga stands for ball grid array so rather than having the legs that stick out it has a

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:53.200
number of solder balls underneath the chip so you would need to heat up the motherboard so much

01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:02.640
that all of those balls heat up and can turn into liquid solder which you can then scoop off now this

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:08.480
requires really quite high temperatures but not too high or else you'll burn and damage the chip

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:17.440
so the setup is usually we've got the motherboard that's clipped on uh with some helping hands and a hot

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:25.680
air gun pointing straight at the phone and you're just heating it up until it's ready and you have to

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:35.920
successfully detach every single ball if you miss one there's a possibility you've ruined the entire chip

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:47.120
just by missing one if that one ball had an important data point so it is very focused very challenging

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.840
incredibly grateful that my friend cubos has even been willing to do this at all because a lot of

01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:00.400
people have not been that's probably part of what's um why there hasn't necessarily been more

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:08.560
research done on these phones because this physical dumping process is so intensive then to make things

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:16.800
worse um all of these chips almost all of the chips have epoxy covering underneath them so there's

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:26.480
an epoxy covering between the chip and the motherboard um they're in they are um given the epoxy for

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:34.160
durability which is important for mobile devices because when they are bouncing around in your pocket

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.240
and being used in other situations unlike a computer or a console that's just going to be staying in the

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.600
same spot they're going for maximum durability the only way this epoxy can be removed is also by heating

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:56.560
the chip to a high temperature and removing the uh the epoxy often this means taking the soldering iron

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:04.080
and heating it up and very carefully scraping it off again making sure that you don't damage any of the

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:11.120
pads on the chip because if you damage the wrong one even if it's just one you've ruined the chip and you

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:21.280
can't read anything amazingly uh cubus has dumped almost close to 100 chips perhaps and has only

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:29.520
uh had issues with maybe one or two that's amazing this is a very high success rate an incredible success rate

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:39.600
um and that's only the beginning so that's just getting a chip off of the motherboard but the thing

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:50.240
with these chips is that a lot of them were created in a proprietary manner just for these phones so you can't

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:59.120
find data sheets about these chips instead there's a lot of research and reverse engineering that is

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:07.200
necessary where you find chips that are similar adjacent um even if they don't have quite the

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.440
right match and so when the chips are similar but not the same there's a lot of guesswork that happens

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:21.520
in between so when cubus makes the chip adapters they're all inferences we don't actually know how

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:27.600
it's going to work until it's plugged in oftentimes there will be one wire that actually needs to go somewhere

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.960
else so you'll see lots of wire soldered on top of the adapter to connect various pins to one another

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:43.920
also um cutting various traces and such so why do we need the adapters it's because the most affordable

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:55.840
chip readers use a 48 pin dip dip zip socket let me say that again 48 pin dip zip socket so um the a lot of

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.920
the adapters that can read these chips directly the chip readers cost literally thousands of dollars

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:11.200
the chip readers that have this 48 pin sockets are more like 100 200 something that someone could

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:18.880
reasonably afford as a hobbyist so the adapters are designed to translate various chip pinouts to that

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:28.720
format um to add another layer to this many of the chips are multi-chip packages so they're combining

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:37.440
nor nand sram dram into one package with shared lines which makes it difficult to identify pin functions

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.880
or avoid conflicts without a data sheet but of course we don't have data sheets for a lot of these chips

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:50.160
so special care has to be taken with this with like the chip enable lines to prevent multiple dies from

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:56.960
outputting data simultaneously which is going to result in unreadable data and sometimes it's almost

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.840
unavoidable to deal with this if they happen to share the same there are some situations where so many things

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:11.120
are shared the data is just kind of garbled so cubus has had to dump multiple times and then we have to

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.200
piece the different parts of the dump together where some of it got garbled but some of it didn't and

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:24.240
then another one where a different part got garbled but the part garbled in the first one was clean

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:34.240
it reminds me of the floppy disk dumping that we do where we use flux technology and we you you can have

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:45.120
a floppy disk that is somewhat broken or damaged and you can copy uh the data from another of a uh another

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:54.960
copy of the same floppy disk so similar um mindset of preserving it there i love it piecing it together

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.240
and i haven't even i actually haven't finished the whole list of problems that occur when trying to dump

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:08.320
these phones another issue that comes up is with the budget chip readers themselves um most commercial

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:16.160
chip readers are limited by fixed reading algorithms and timing and so if the chip reader does not have

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:23.680
the algorithm that matches the chip you can't use it you just can't dump it so what happens in that case

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:29.920
well one of the things that cubus has been working on more recently is diy solutions using an arduino

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:37.680
to be able to read these chips they offer more flexibility but are slower and also require

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:44.720
additional components such as level shifters which sometimes need to be applied very carefully by hand

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.520
too many legs

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:54.000
and so ultimately the work requires a good deal of engineering effective work

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.480
and a very delicate handiwork to get a chance at extracting data

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:12.160
so one of the challenges that i don't think me or cubus expected when we went into dumping a lot of

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:23.520
these chips was a not a lot of support and feedback from other people knowledgeable in technical

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.200
engineering the way that conversations will usually go is we will talk about these chips how they are

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.920
proprietary how the data sheets don't exist so people and people say no they must exist they have

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.120
to exist like why would that not exist once we get past that point of proving yes this stuff is

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.400
isn't there they get to the point of well why are you wasting so much time trying to dump this very

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.120
obscure chip

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:57.280
what's the point i guess that's the way to i don't know um and so it's been difficult to recruit other

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:03.760
people who might have knowledge of this because there seem to be some some strange preconceptions

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:13.120
questions about the worth of a project that is this difficult um i think that in the conversation

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:20.080
that we're having here in this podcast the value of this is obvious we have been able to exploit

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.560
significantly more phones the usb directly because of many chip duns that was that was uh done by cubus

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:35.120
in order for exploits to be found you need a sample firmware a sample of the bootloader

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.920
so unless we have a chip dump we're going in completely blind and it's basically impossible to figure

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.840
out an exploit these chip dumps have allowed us to not go in blind we have been able to dump a wider variety

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:55.280
of phones we can now dump at least one phone from every single dokuma manufacturer at this point

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.600
we have a method for all of them which has been amazing

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.200
uh so i hope that there can be more interest and support in the hardware side

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.600
um well i hope that for everything the hacking side the hardware side there's just

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:18.320
it's that's a pretty small group of people who even know about all this stuff um but it's such a

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.200
fascinating and interesting challenge for people who might be wondering what they can do to use their

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:33.680
skills in a new and inventive manner for people who are looking to explore a realm where unlike a lot of

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:41.280
the other retro consoles the nintendo consoles the sega consoles sony uh etc etc it is really a lot of

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.600
unexplored technical territory and we are making new and amazing discoveries every day and i think

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:53.920
that's a good segue into what max is going to talk about with regards to the sideloading

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.880
yeah yeah definitely and i think the way you put it just before i go to sideloading i think the way

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.800
you stated that was really is really good because yeah it's not just against the the technical hurdles

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.800
right but it's also just a lot of preconceived notions against these games in general

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.560
because as we all know in the west flip phone games really were like snake you know people

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.040
always kind of stop at snake you know or really crappy flip phone games that run at like two frames

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.040
a second so when i so when you go up to somebody and say i'm preserving games on japanese flip phones

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.960
the first thing that comes to their mind is like oh it's snake it's crap it's not worth preserving

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:37.360
but well firstly all games deserve to be preserved obviously you know there's no i mean even the bad ones

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.520
right but it as we've seen in this podcast and the two previous ones there are so many gems on japanese

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.320
feature phones and all of them and there really were the precursors to modeled mobile games as we know

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.760
them especially in the way they were distributed they were distributed digitally a lot of them use the

01:19:53.760 --> 01:20:00.160
subscription-based distribution models where new content was delivered monthly or sometimes weekly to

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.640
these games and that's not dissimilar from how server-reliant mobile games are today so in a sense

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.320
that these games are really like they're important in gaming history mobile gaming history at large

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.880
and that's why all of us here have been you know doing our best to raise awareness about these games so

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:22.880
i really do appreciate that point but back to what you were saying about side loading so the user xyz who

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:29.360
was the one who figured out this well he was he was one of two people who figured out this non-destructive

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:37.040
dumping method through this debug cable he figured out that on certain later devices i think it's like

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:45.040
the second to last panasonic imode phone ever created uh the p01f he discovered that with the debug cable

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.600
um obviously the specifics are above my head but he realized that you can side load um games onto this by

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:56.480
basically tricking the phone that it's a pre-installed application because on dokomo phones

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:03.520
in particular pre-installed apps and games don't require a sim card to run but if you have a paid

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.640
game you have to have the original sim card that you bought the game with or else the game refuses to

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:14.080
launch now of course when you run that through the dokomo sdk that verification is not there because

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.040
it's not on the phone but if you do want to play the game on the phone basically what xyz did was just

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.800
say okay for example i don't know rockman.exe fanta network i'm going to put it on the phone but the

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.320
phone's going to think it's pre-installed so it's not going to ask for that verification and in doing

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:36.000
so we were able to sideload games onto basically original hardware for the first time now there are

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.200
some limitations for some reason that there's no gyroscope inside of this which means that the motion

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.360
control games don't work they just kind of glitch out and it's possible to sideload games with sd card

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:53.840
data but it's it's kind of a convoluted process but it is possible but if there's one game that i

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.240
do want to highlight that's sideloadable and actually the the experience is elevated through

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.720
sideloading it it's a game that we preserved not even a week ago um is uh it's called real zero

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:10.000
another edition and real zero well zero the series is actually better known as fatal frame

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:16.160
actually no yeah yeah fatal frame yes and in the west and basically the whole thing about that

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:20.160
series is oh you have a camera and you take a picture of a ghost and ah scary ghost

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:26.640
you know so basically though they this is in 2004 they say wait a minute what if we made a game

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.920
for keitai that utilized the camera and you take a picture of an object and the ghost shows up and

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.120
then on like using the picture you took as the background you kind of immersively try to destroy

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.440
the ghost and that's exactly what we did we found a trial version of that and incubus preserved it

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:52.160
and from a chip dump mainly and basically what this this game does is um it looks for like a image

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.800
that's bright enough so i either for my for my demo i had to like point it out of like a light source

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:02.400
basically you know to make it be happy then the ghost shows up and then you you kill the ghost and

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.440
then it takes you to like a fake phone menu like they built a little mini phone menu inside there and

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:12.640
there are emails fake emails from the game and these emails are saying stuff like oh there are ghosts

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.040
around i'm so scared you know like i wonder what would happen if i took my camera out right now

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:23.040
dot dot dot you know but basically the demo ends at that point but there were 60 ghosts available for

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.160
that game and basically it's like that's an experience that you can you can play it through

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.400
the emulator you can select an image from your computer and load it but i think having it side

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.880
loadable and be able to take the picture yourself i think it's just a really cool experience

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:43.840
yeah and if i can add on to that like there are a bunch of these dojo phones that have you know

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:53.280
gyroscopes camera you know gps some of them have extra buttons other ones can detach and the sdk

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.720
emulator just can't do that so at least for scroll jamie i'm hoping to get all those kind of

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:06.800
control sets in because you know we have all those kind of controls now so it's just

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:13.440
the only way to like truly play those games is to sideload you know so

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:23.360
and i guess it's kind of like you have the eye toy and the wiimote you have those games that you're

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:30.960
never going to see on like the switch or something because like it uses that one thing that just

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.560
you know nothing ever uses

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:43.360
this is uh again i've said it many times during this podcast this is just amazing work by everyone

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:51.040
involved and i'm so so happy that you all took the time here today to talk about your your work your

01:24:51.040 --> 01:25:01.360
progress your your chips your phones uh your javas uh your everything so we're gonna uh wrap up this

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:09.920
podcast here uh and as we do that i would like to invite you all to tell the audience tell our

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.200

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.480

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:42.800
primarily i mean if you need me for anything just mention me uh right now we're just doing a lot of

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.520
stuff with a new launcher not sure if everybody's aware of that but we've made it a lot easier for

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:53.280
people to play the games um so that definitely helps but doing some troubleshooting debugging and

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.800
so um great to be here thank you so much for inviting me especially as kind of being the new guy

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.840

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:15.920
fantastic uh stephanie uh yeah so um i'm on blue sky as a zero shadow tail i'm also on mastodon

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:26.480
which is a zero shadow tail at chitter dot xyz because i'm squirrel so but i'm also in the ktai

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:33.040
wiki discord and there's also the squirrel jamie discord as well and there's an irc there's an irc channel

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:45.680
too if you like irc still but uh i'll be continuing working on basically the on nanocoat getting that

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:52.960
working getting that online and obviously you know they'll be testing things running things and you know

01:26:52.960 --> 01:27:06.720
basically if you can break it then i can fix it but yeah thank you for having me here and it's been

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:13.760
you know really really great and i enjoyed it thank you thank you thank you ellen

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:23.840
so for me um there are a few things like uh like uh stephanie mentioned we have ktai wiki the ktai

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:30.560
wiki is a website and a wiki but we have a discord that is attached or associated with the wiki and

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.400
that's where a lot of the community is and that's where a lot of the brainstorming and invention

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:42.320
and reverse engineering is happening so that would be the best place for anyone interested

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:49.440
in japanese feature phones to go additionally i have some social media accounts under the username

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:55.920
unabandoned where where i post some content so i have unabandoned where on blue sky unabandoned where

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:03.200
on youtube and most recently unabandoned where on tiktok where i just shared a video of a panasonic

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:11.040
po1a that got over 500 000 views still blows my mind i don't know that's wild that's why it's a

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.840
very cool phone though if any of you happen to have a tiktok and want to see the video it is

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.920
it's a fascinating phone the hardware of these phones in addition to the software it was just amazing

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.920
awesome and last but not least max yeah so i'm not as cool as ellen i don't have a tiktok

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:38.800
despite being in the age demographic but i am on twitter and blue sky under uh my username rockman

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:46.080
cosmo i'm also on discord under the same username and yeah i mean if for future things i want to do

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:51.280
this year it really is just expanding you know the outreach raising more awareness and that's always

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.240
what i've been about so like i said in the past year in august i presented at an academic conference

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.760
but also at the strong museum of play on keita game preservation i like to say it was one of the

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.640
best four days of my life i got to meet jonas i got to meet ellen and it was just such a special

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.520
experience and i really got to see like how much interest there is in these games not just from game

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.920
preservationists but also academics because apparently this is an academic field that just

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.120
no one's discussing even the japanese themselves they're shocked that i care

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:27.680
so i am definitely gonna over the next year i'm probably gonna try to do more of those things and

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:34.400
maybe the next podcast a secret bigger project that might talk about but um but yeah other than that

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.000
