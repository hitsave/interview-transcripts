0	7680	hello everyone and welcome to yet another hit save podcast this time we're doing a deep dive into the
7680	15920	keitai phone game japanese phone game preservation that's happening and i got four
15920	21360	lovely people with me here today we got ellen cooper who's also a board member here at hit save
21360	30880	we got stephanie garorski uh who is the founder and uh maintainer of squirrel jme we got rockman
30880	41280	cosmo also known as max and we got yubi hi everyone hello hi hey how's it going so before we kick off
41280	46480	with all the technical stuff and all the games that you have preserved in the past year i would
46480	53280	like you all to introduce yourself to the audience here so we can start off in the same order as we
53280	62880	did in the introduction here so ellen sure hi i'm ellen i am a board member for hit save i am also
62880	70480	the founder of keitai wiki which is a wiki dedicated to recording information on japanese phone games i
70480	79120	have involvement in the hardware and software parts of um feature phone hacking and i also
79120	86480	just do a lot of general organization um with regards to the wiki and to the community awesome
86480	96480	stephanie uh yeah so um i'm stephanie and i work on scroll jamie which is a java me8 virtual machine
96480	104480	and i've been working on that since 2016 and pretty much i've been working on dojo support and mint piece
104480	113600	support so western and i guess eastern phones and that's been going pretty well uh keitai wiki wise
114320	121040	um i don't really do much apart from you know sometimes i help out yubi when he's doing the reverse
121040	136720	engineering so basically i know lots of java so awesome awesome and uh max hi yeah i'm max also
136720	142400	known online as rockman cosmo um i'm a game preservationist who specializes in japanese feature
142400	148640	phone games so i'm kind of like like the leading advocate i guess for the preservation of these games
148640	154800	but i've also done some of the preservation work myself but yeah since i think like since the imo
154800	160880	shut down in november 2021 i guess i've dedicated too much of my life to preserving these kinds of
160880	166480	games it's kind of consumed me but it's also led me to you know come across all these wonderful people
166480	172240	that are on these podcasts and yeah i continue to spread awareness and actually last summer as i'll
172240	178480	discuss later i actually spoke at two conferences on this so it's been a wonderful past year
178880	185920	awesome and last but not least yubi hey how's it going uh yubi or sometimes you might see me as a
185920	191920	yubi app uh on the socials uh kind of the i don't know new guy to the team i guess the best way of
191920	196560	putting it uh i don't know how long i've been here maybe like almost a year now probably eight months
196560	203200	nine months all around there uh primarily focus on a reverse engineering of server-based
203200	210960	uh i mode games or even just tool creation of any kind uh previously mostly i'm a translation guy
210960	216560	doing all the hacking for getting translations from japanese english and then kind of took my skill
216560	229040	sets and uh use them for good now on the keitai side so so what i do awesome awesome so i wanted to dive
229040	237680	into the keitai wiki a bit and start off there so ellen you started the keitai wiki a while ago
238480	246240	yes i started yeah sorry i started it in august of 2023 so it's getting close to uh two years about a
246240	254640	year and a half so what is it what what's the keitai wiki about the keitai wiki is a collection of
254640	263040	information about japanese feature phone games applications and other related media it's a place
263040	269520	that records a lot of this information in english which is not written about on almost any other
269520	279440	sites so it's a treasure trove for anyone who wants to get into preserving japanese phones and
279440	285760	phone games absolutely but that being said even though it's getting close to two years old the
285760	293200	wiki is definitely still in the early phases that's still a lot of pages that need to be made there are
293200	298960	thousands of games released and while we have a lot of the important ones and a lot of the ones
298960	305840	that we have found on the wiki there is still way more to be said and way more to be written and added
305840	317840	yeah looking at the keitai phones and the games that were on these phones they weren't really here in
317840	327120	the western part of the world at all they were over there in japan uh had a an immense catalog of games
327120	335440	and fantastic really really cool phones as well that um were very advanced for the time yeah um
335440	344480	on that note there was actually one phone that was released in the us uh i forgot what the model was
344480	353920	exactly but it was like the only dojo phone that was released here and they called it m mode instead of
353920	367040	like i mode but uh basically they wanted to uh actually found that out from there's the
368800	374960	video game history foundation they made that archive with all the information so i did a search on there
374960	382960	and then i found that that phone was actually talked about in one of the game magazines oh so that was like
382960	390560	really cool that was really cool so like that archive popped up and just learned something from it
390560	397200	pretty quickly um obviously it was a business oriented phone and you know that was the only phone and
397840	405920	after that uh it didn't do anything else with it so it kind of was a a flop
405920	416640	uh bad uh i've been watching all the uh the clips that you all post about uh the games that you have
416640	426080	preserved and it's so it's so cool to see all these games that were made for phones before we had the
426080	433520	iphone and android phones and things like that and the way they run they run really well many of them and
433520	442400	they're fantastic ports some of them uh many of them are original games so max maybe you can fill us in
442400	450400	on some of the notable finds that you have done in the past year 100 yeah there have been so many
450400	455200	crazy finds it's like i had a i was writing this whole notes for myself here and i realized just how
455200	462000	many games we found in the past year and actually recently we did pass the 800 mark for idmo games at
462000	467600	least so now over 800 i mode games are preserved so that's that's unbelievable because if you remember
467600	473600	only like two years ago it was like zero so that's the incredible growth but yeah on onto this more
473600	481920	specific games um let's see so i want to start from last may and go to the present so may uh we had the
481920	489200	easy web versions of the rockman.exe games preserved so if you remember uh megaman battle network had two
489200	495360	original entries on katai and we had preserved the imode versions but there is a competitor service
495360	501280	by kddi called easy web and that's actually where those two games were originally released
501280	509040	so thanks to the expertise of craze we were able to extract those games but also another side
509040	514800	application called battler's tower which had like online leaderboards but because that has a network
514800	519600	check we have not been able to crack it but it's kind of crazy that we found another copy of those
519600	526800	already rare games then a month later in june we partially preserved a game called oi katamari
526800	534560	damasi kun and if you remember the psp entry in the katamari series me and my katamari the end credits
534560	540000	has this mini game where you're rolling a katamari but it's like in this pixel style and it's in 2d
540000	545600	and you and you go side to side basically and you go along this long stage so basically they said what
545600	550160	if we just take that end credits mini game and make an entirely original game out of it by just adding a
550160	556960	bunch of you know original stages and that's what oi katamari damasi kun was so i i forget how many
556960	562560	stages we have in particular but it's not all of them but we do have a good amount so we did preserve
562560	569920	that in june and then in july if you remember from two years back naoya shinoda was the first guest on
569920	576240	here alongside with me um he scored a massive square enix imode game hall after like years of
576240	584400	negotiations so he preserved about 19 games um including a partial copy of before crisis final
584400	590640	fantasy 7 which uv will talk about later that's its own can of worms but also the full copy of
590640	597440	kingdom hearts coded dirge of cerberus lost episode now those two games are missing their sd card data
597440	603840	but actually as i speak right now um naoya is working on obtaining that sd card data but we also
603840	610240	found numerous kingdom hearts imode mini games um even final fantasy 7 snowboarding which was actually
610240	617200	the first imode game to have its leaderboards restored um thanks to uv again um and then also
617200	624560	even the full imode remake of of saiken densetsu which was a game boy game but they actually had a full like
624560	631680	color remake of it that was exclusive to imode and then let's see what else do we have here in july
631680	638000	um ellen preserved tetris dj which is a rhythm based tetris game uh yeah she she's extremely proud
638000	644960	of that one it's a really fun game in and of itself um in august uv preserved the entirety of professor
644960	650720	layton and the mansion of the deathly mayor that was an original professor layton um game and that was
650720	656160	it's actually canon to the series too which is very interesting um interestingly the phone that he
656160	662240	preserved it from it it was horribly burnt like the screen wasn't working so i said it looks like it
662240	667440	got burnt in a house fire but then all the gaming news websites they saw i said that and they reported
667440	673520	it like it was fact so now everyone thinks the phone did survive a house fire but we don't know for
673520	682880	sure um yeah then september uv once again preserves nine capcom imode games including an original imode
682880	688480	capcom rpg called your planet where it's like a spherical 3d overworld so it's kind of like
688480	693440	if you walked around a planet in mario galaxy that's kind of like your overworld basically with
693440	701520	traditional turn-based combat then december before crisis strikes again except this time the demo is
701520	708560	preserved from um an easy web phone by the one and only craze and it turns out that the data from
708560	715280	that can be combined with the documo copy as uv will also get into and yes i mean there's so many
715280	721120	more but if i had to pick one that was recent it would have to be an anonymous user preserving the
721120	728640	entirety of xenosaga pied piper this was this is a massive find because it was six separate apps but it
728640	734560	is a canonical story set i for i think it's before the first xenosaga game but people have been
734560	739760	searching this for this for so long that after i posted the news a lot of people told me that they
739760	745760	legitimately like broke into tears upon hearing it like i didn't realize that so many people had
745760	752400	wanted this game for so long so that was very recently earlier in march which is when we're recording
752400	757840	this but yeah it's very recent someone's already working on a fan translation of it that's amazing
758720	762960	it's it's just been an incredible time i could go on forever about the games but yeah those are some
762960	772720	of the best hits i mean just you're talking about games that have been locked away i think we maybe we
772720	778240	should take a little step back here because the when we talk about i mode and the phones that we're
778240	785280	talking about here they many of them are reliant on the network to be available and the i mode network
785280	794000	was shut down years ago um so you can no longer download these games uh and they are on phones
794000	801680	that have been stuffed in drawers essentially and and uh forgotten by the world for over a decade
801680	811200	exactly so finding them and being able to restore them and show them to people is just a wonderful
811200	818160	thing so thank you everyone for everything that you're doing here so tell me a bit about the latent
818160	826480	game that was saved there uh because that was um a a full latent game and you said it was canonical as
826480	834000	well yeah i'm not sure about this i guess the specific things i actually have not uh played a
834000	840720	latent game myself so i'm not the best person to be talking about this but um but it seems like it
840720	847520	i think it takes place between some of some of the ds games but yeah interestingly in comparison to
847520	852160	some of the other games like they could have made this a server-based game because as you said
852160	858480	um like the average size for an imode game if the audience doesn't know was one megabyte which is
859040	864720	that that's not very big basically so a lot of games had to resort to creative ways to i guess
864720	870000	overcome this limit so some of them as we have mentioned like rockman dash five islands or kingdom hearts
870000	876000	coded use the sd card for the extra data and some games like before crisis were jerks and decided to
876000	881360	just rely on a server for the whole thing but professor layton and as well as actually xenosaga like
881360	886560	i mentioned earlier they decided to split their game into separate apps so each so there i think
886560	892080	there's six chapters in professor layton in the mansion of deathly mayor and there's one app for
892080	898640	each chapter so basically that makes preserving it a little more difficult because you do have to find
898640	904960	a phone with all six chapters but lo and behold uv's luck you know it just happened to work and
904960	910240	he happened to find a phone with all six chapters on it and the same goes for xenosaga that was also
910240	918720	also three chapters but each chapter had to be split into two apps so that's how that game came out and
918720	924720	yeah they apparently released a remix version of it too um that was called a it was called it had the
924720	929520	same name but it had a remix at the end and that one actually has different puzzles slightly better
929520	935840	animations and even slightly different dialogues so we have not found that version yet but there is video
935840	941280	footage of it online but it's also interesting just think like the fact that they would re-release an
941280	950000	i-mode game you know it's interesting yeah those during the time i had a string of good luck i felt with phones
950000	965360	yeah and also um on top of that there is the uh you have the scratchpad and stuff so it's kind of like
965360	972800	dlc so scratchpad is like the storage space for the software and normally you'd use it for like
974560	979440	game state or you know whatever else like contacts or whatever else and you know whatever
979440	987120	software software to keep it state but since the size of the programs were pretty limited
988240	993920	and the scratchpad could be much larger basically what would happen is that they would download from
993920	1000000	a server and cache that information in the scratchpad and then load it from that scratchpad
1000000	1011680	so basically if the app was downloaded but never ran then it would never have gotten that scratchpad
1011680	1021520	initialized and that's another issue as well with a lot of the software and titles so basically
1021520	1027360	basically there have been cases where we found you know incomplete titles
1028800	1035760	essentially and sometimes complete titles that were you know trial locked
1038160	1046320	um oh one thing i want to add is um so the remix version um i don't recall if you said this in the in
1046320	1051440	the same order but the remix version is for the professor laden there is not a remix version of
1051440	1058720	xenosaga pied piper yes yeah for a moment i thought that's what you said and i was like what no no i'm not
1058720	1062240	gonna drop that on you guys no way i'm gonna do that
1066720	1075520	so uv i wanted to dive into the the burnt phone here that max was talking about a bit uh and that
1075520	1083040	was the game where the latent game on it so when you when you got that phone what did you what did you
1083040	1091040	think was going to happen uh let's see so this is back i don't know how many months ago that was but
1091040	1096080	back when i was getting a string of a lot of lots and so i think roughly probably got two three hundred
1096080	1102560	phones in some lot that i got and a lot of those phones i mean you know they all look normally used
1102560	1107680	they all just kind of somebody used them in their lifetime right but this one in particular was just
1107680	1111520	kind of out and i actually had set it to the side for quite some time because it was not
1111520	1118160	booting correctly to which uh normally what i do is if i get a phone i'll try and turn it on see what
1118160	1122960	apps there are and then there's nothing of value i set it into a box that is kind of my junk box
1122960	1128720	right and then if there's things on there that i need i put it into a dump pile oh this phone i set
1128720	1134800	aside there because it didn't turn on at first but uh because we felt like we had to make sure and
1134800	1140960	normally when i do this i'll i'll put the phone in to get dumped and so ended up we actually dumped
1140960	1148320	this phone um before i even got it working and turning on uh and the condition of it was not
1148320	1154240	great uh and so this is kind of where the meme of a house fire phone came because actually if you look
1154240	1160640	at the phone physically it looks like it had some charring of some sort to it or or it was in a very
1160640	1167200	nasty place that gave it that type of look um and so you look at the phone you look at the connector
1167200	1174400	port for uh uh where the charger cable goes and our debug cable goes it was uh not so nice and so
1174400	1180320	with a little bit of cleaning and uh just was able to plug it in thankfully it turned on and we were able
1180320	1186240	to dump the contents but of course when i dumped it i had no idea what was on this phone that i was just
1186240	1193520	expecting there to be nothing but if i recall this is the phone that gave us lots more than just
1193520	1200720	latent as well i think it had tons of other namco and konami not konami but uh namco games on it as
1200720	1207760	well uh so it was quite a gold find for us especially with all the latent games and uh what ended up
1207760	1213520	happening at you know for whatever reason unbeknownst to me i i guess there was a bounty for the first
1213520	1219120	person who would find the rest of the chapters uh the professor latent games and
1219120	1224160	guy hits me up he's like hey you got fifteen hundred dollars to your name and i'm like i'm
1224160	1230480	sorry what that's like hey he's like here's fifteen hundred dollars and i was like yeah that's crazy
1230480	1236640	first off why you have a bounty for that but i mean loyal fans what can we say i'm sure somebody
1236640	1242560	would be willing to put up a bounty for before crisis or something right but latent fans um
1243360	1248400	so yeah i met a bounty and then i just didn't feel right for just what i do is just i bought a
1248400	1255520	lot of phones i just happened to find it uh so sure most people know but we ended up donating that
1255520	1260800	money out to hit save uh just because it made more sense uh for it to go somewhere and be used
1260800	1265920	besides me just sitting on it and not really needing the money because we're already spending our
1265920	1271520	own money to buy these lots so at the end of the day if uh if it goes somewhere else and gets used better
1271520	1277120	so it's a better cause it's really really appreciated so i wanted to thank you in person
1277120	1282800	as well so thank you no worries no worries but yeah that's kind of the story of that phone i mean
1282800	1288240	and i don't remember who it was but there was one person in the discord that kind of said oh it looks
1288240	1292880	like a house fire like it survived a house fire or something like that and somehow every new story
1292880	1298320	just kind of picked up on that of that case because i think cosmo uh had put in his uh his uh
1298320	1303920	ex post of the saying look like it survived a house fire and therefore everybody kind of went
1303920	1309360	off on that and so it's now deemed the house fire phone so we'll never forget it
1312160	1318560	that's awesome now i will say that i think it is quite obvious uh i think most of us honestly we
1318560	1324080	look for these type of phones uh because somehow they always end up giving us the best things uh
1324080	1328160	they went through a hard life and somehow if they went through a hard life they normally have some
1328160	1332560	goods on them and that's kind of panned out to be honest i feel like every time i've seen a phone that
1332560	1338960	snapped in half they sometimes have something on them a lot of reason for that is because
1338960	1347680	if the phone is broken it's difficult to initialize the data yeah yeah like you can't just wipe it so
1347680	1353440	that's uh that yeah that's true yeah that makes a lot of sense
1356240	1360320	so with all these games and the data that you preserve from these phones
1362160	1368000	stephanie you're working on a project to actually be able to play these games not on the phones but
1368000	1376000	on a computer so can you tell us a bit about squirrel jme and how it works and and the work you've
1376000	1385280	been doing in the past year yeah so squirrel jme is a java me 8 virtual machine which basically
1386800	1394080	there's your desktop java and java me is basically a subset of that so much smaller for embedded
1394080	1402800	devices like phones iot devices you know like fridges and stuff like that and basically these
1402800	1407600	phones are kind of just like the extension of that like what could run on like a fridge
1407600	1419760	or something like that right so pretty much from that the things that i've been doing is that
1421440	1429440	a lot of the times with these older games is that they're made for older phones and devices
1429440	1440960	right and there's a lot of assumptions about kind of like how the processor acts and so i mean not to
1440960	1449760	kind of complicate things but basically we've advanced in cpu technology so you have like
1450560	1457840	16 core cpus now with hyper threading and stuff like that you know super duper gpus
1458800	1466320	and the thing is these phones back then one thing is that they just have one single cpu
1467280	1475440	just executing everything you know just next to each other right code wise
1476320	1483200	and one of the big issues with that is that because of the advances in technology
1484000	1493120	that a lot of this older software runs differently if you were to run it today on modern cpus and modern jvms
1494000	1501920	because everything's just kind of like a moving target so my goal with squirrel jamie is essentially
1501920	1512720	to have kind of like a snapshot of sorts so that you can like experience these games right and
1512720	1524320	essentially just be able to play them for example so with regards to that uh there's for example the megaman
1524320	1536640	games and then there's also like tetris game i believe as well where essentially it will just break if you try
1536640	1544720	running it on kind of like an environment that it wasn't made for it just won't run properly
1546240	1553120	and for squirrel jamie i kind of like force it into that box to where
1553120	1563280	where it's closer to how things were back in the early 2000s in the mid 2000s and that like increases
1563280	1570240	compatibility with the software and that's a lot of the stuff that i've been doing in the past year
1570240	1575280	is uh pretty much kind of like that
1578080	1582080	you know very hard integration
1584720	1594000	so i know in previous podcasts we've been we've talked about the um sdk i believe it was i can't
1594000	1599920	remember what it was exactly but yes exactly the sdk emulator so this is
1599920	1607680	the um uh what you're creating here is something that is way more robust way more performant
1608240	1617680	yeah and yeah just available for more people yeah basically uh you'll be able to at some point
1617680	1624080	you know use a game pad with things and play with it because the sdk is just it's made for developers
1625040	1630000	it was never intended to be used you know to actually play the games
1631840	1642000	and you know i am hoping to get like better audio support more performant audio support and kind of just
1642000	1651280	like making it a much better experience of course you know that stuff takes time so i'm hoping this year
1651280	1660320	i can get something which it'll be interesting um you can actually sort of do things now with the
1660320	1667680	standalone version which does actually kind of run stuff so that's pretty neat so that's a call to
1667680	1676960	action to any java developers who love to work on audio to come and help out yeah basically
1677680	1686720	if there's any audio so of course audio is not like the priority right now so that'd be a little
1686720	1692640	bit more later on because right now the priority is kind of just getting the more important bits if that makes
1692640	1703760	sense so that's great um i see here in our podcast notes as well something about nano coat
1703760	1710800	you want to talk about that yeah so nano coat is the virtual machine i'm working on that is written in c
1710800	1719680	and that would be running on retro arc for example and that would be running on say you know your phone
1721120	1728880	or your desktop or maybe even like the ps2 your 3ds because uh retro arc is kind of like on everything
1730160	1736560	so i am part of retro arc team you know it's mostly just volunteers for the most part
1737520	1745840	but it's basically the native port and it's kind of like so i have spring code which is written in java
1745840	1752960	and that's kind of like the baseline virtual machine that i wrote initially you know completely
1752960	1761520	in java and now i'm working on a native c1 that'll be more portable and cross-platform to where
1761520	1769360	you don't need a host virtual machine to actually run the virtual machine so essentially you know you
1769360	1777680	can run it on a 3ds or your desktop or your phone and then you won't need to have this very huge
1778320	1787600	cumbersome java installation just to be able to play the software and the thing with the sdk emulator is
1787600	1794080	that you also have to have that you know cumbersome desktop java to be able to run stuff
1795840	1806320	so essentially nano code you know nano being small and it's essentially just going to be a leaner virtual
1806320	1815680	machine so this is going to be a very user-friendly method of being able to play these games going forward
1815680	1824320	yeah or that's the goal at least yeah that's the goal and if you're using like the uh retroarch front
1824320	1833760	end then uh there'll be of course like controller support and then i'll have to figure out like
1833760	1842240	save states and stuff like that which will be interesting because java itself doesn't really
1842240	1852880	lend itself to such things but i think i can make that work uh that i am very very excited to see
1853760	1860720	how you progress with this because that would make it um a lot easier for for people to actually try
1860720	1868640	these out the games that you have preserved and um yeah make make some deep dive videos on them and
1868640	1878400	enjoy them yeah but it does involve lots of uh research yeah but like most of the time
1880320	1886240	my time is spent just like researching and then developing and then also refactoring because
1887200	1896240	because this is such a big complex project you know it's the you have like the 95 of projects
1896240	1903920	this is like the five percent of projects where no other project kind of how you would do that applies
1904400	1909120	so everything has to be done differently and i know
1911120	1915920	i've said that you know squirrel jamie would be out like last year this year but the thing is
1916720	1922880	you know i do work but also as well there is a lot of research and making sure that everything's done
1922880	1930960	right the first time right the first time you know so that way it's easy when things get broke they're
1930960	1942240	easy to fix which you know they are thankfully yeah so and also as well um to kind of get like that
1942240	1952240	kind of experience where it doesn't like frustrate you to use it if that makes sense
1955040	1961600	yeah yeah i think that makes a lot of sense and i i love that you're working with the retro art team
1961600	1967840	and trying to make it more user friendly but i absolutely understand there's a lot of research going
1968640	1977520	going into this project and you do have a day job as well yeah which is uh working on medical devices so
1978960	1986480	very different very different yeah and also pretty important so and uh
1986480	1997840	uh sometimes i get off work and you know i'm kind of tired so totally get that yeah but thanks have
1997840	2006640	been going well that's awesome so what have been the the most fun thing that you have done in squirrel jamie
2006640	2018480	um lately um most thing the thing that you think either a quirky thing that you finally figured out
2018480	2026400	or something that made it run better or something like that um there's actually something silly
2026400	2037840	uh it turns out that i had well if you knew java bytecode there is an instruction called table switch
2039360	2040480	which is basically
2042960	2050800	a jump table of one two three four five so say like if one go to this address if two go to this address
2050800	2062480	etc right and uh that was implemented incorrectly um i was running some dojo software which ended up crashing
2062480	2071040	uh because uh i was running it in spring coat which is very uh pedantic about everything right
2072160	2076560	which that's the purpose of it so this one dojo software kind of just
2078160	2083520	broke and then it's just like oh i implemented it wrong
2083520	2092320	oops oops that's great that's great to find though um yeah and it's just like it worked
2093200	2101120	for five years without issues and just this one random dojo software just breaks it
2102560	2106400	that's funny it's it's hilarious i love that
2106400	2121360	so yeah it's just like uh kind of like checking all this dojo software is kind of just like
2122160	2131040	interesting and kind of just has improved squirrel jamie in general so and this also helps out you know
2131040	2139680	western software as well like the mid p games because it just you know it's more surface area for testing
2141840	2147440	and i guess probably one of the most important things is like testing and making sure things work
2149120	2155040	yeah yeah for sure i mean you can you can implement things but if they don't work they don't
2155040	2160720	work so yeah testing is really important yeah and implementation wise i do kind of
2161040	2170560	uh fail fast which is a programming term to where when you encounter a failure state or an unknown or
2170560	2179120	undefined state then the program terminates so essentially that means
2180880	2187840	squirrel jamie when it knows it's about to enter an unknown program state then it'll just terminate right
2187840	2199440	there rather than continuing which makes things easier to buck to debug easier to implement because i know exactly where that happened and
2202560	2204240	that has kind of just like
2207120	2214160	made things so much easier than doing stuff like game specific hacks and stuff like that
2214160	2224240	that which is uh you know untenable when you have thousands and thousands of titles yeah yeah you want to
2225520	2229840	you want to focus on what what gets most of them over the finish line there yeah pretty much
2231440	2238560	this is awesome so um squirrel jamie where we at hit save we're super happy to
2238560	2247120	uh help with some of the funding for the the development here so i'm super happy to hear about all the yeah and
2247120	2255920	thank you so much progress here it's it's super fun we we love open source projects and yeah we we of course utilize
2255920	2261840	a ton of open source projects ourselves as well so seeing the progress here is fantastic so thank you so much
2261840	2270160	and the funding's been put to good use it's uh being used for the cicd which is basically just
2270880	2276640	constantly building and then testing squirrel jamie with all the tests i wrote you know to make sure
2276640	2285040	things don't just break out of nowhere and that's been making sure that you know things continue to
2285040	2295360	progress well not break and it's actually kind of difficult because even though i'm an open source
2295360	2308400	project you know run by a single person i kind of appear to be like a large i mean it is a large project but
2308400	2319200	like resource and usage wise it's very rare for a project you know as mentioned previously
2320000	2328000	and it's kind of hard to actually find companies that are actually even willing to even help out
2329120	2337680	you know so i'm really glad that you at hit save have helped out so really helps
2338400	2345600	yeah we we love it and so so thank you again thank you i wanted to uh dive into
2347280	2356480	the tetris dj game ellen if you're uh if you can explain this a bit i i because it doesn't make sense
2356480	2363840	to me in my head how does a tetris rhythm game work okay so there are a few things to mention about
2363840	2371360	the game the way that it was found was actually kind of incredible but also not incredible basically
2371360	2376960	i was just looking i took the debug cable i plugged it into every single phone i had
2377600	2383280	this one phone lit up which i did not expect because it was a casio phone and usually only the
2383280	2392080	nec and panasonic phones light out and light up turns out casio casio phones were made by nec
2392080	2399440	in the later years so it was actually just an nec phone i could not open it so i extracted the data
2399440	2407600	like it was an nec phone and it had tetris dj uh what is tetris dj tetris dj uh is a game
2408400	2414560	that includes a dj mode so you can play regular tetris in it as well in the dj mode the goal is to
2414560	2420720	drop the pieces on the beat and if you drop the pieces on the beat you get extra points
2422480	2430400	that's basically it you can kind of emulate this in um the uh softbank proprietary mexa emulator
2430400	2438800	however there is a good deal of lag that makes it a bit tricky to play
2441200	2442560	maybe i could try running it
2444720	2450960	that could be interesting because uh the softbank games though those aren't doja they're actually
2450960	2459280	closer to mid p and there are already some other emulation projects that can run
2459920	2468000	a few of the games from softbank the only problem is they can't emulate the audio so tetris dj with no
2468000	2475520	audio is a lot less fun i bet just uh make up the music in your head
2477920	2483200	have a game boy next to you maybe uh play some tetris tunes yeah
2483200	2494080	so i wanted to dive into before crisis because that's a game that has been talked about in
2494080	2504080	multiple of these podcasts and uv you have been um a star here essentially making sure that that was
2504080	2507840	preserved properly and you also have some um
2507840	2515920	uh you've had some challenges preserving some server-based imode games um which obviously
2515920	2519200	before crisis comes in there so can you tell us a bit about that
2519200	2525840	yeah so uh i mean what isn't there not to say about before crisis i think
2527200	2532560	is it probably the most recognizable imode game probably it's probably the true statement i would
2532560	2539280	say so yes um before crisis is one of those games that everybody kind of knows about everybody wants
2539280	2545120	to play uh kind of almost to the vein of xeno saga but just not with the final fantasy name attached to
2545120	2552560	it is uh thanks to naya as we spoke earlier that he was able to find a copy from us so you see that
2553120	2557840	we even have the ability of uh looking at the game today or even trying to preserve it
2558720	2565920	um and that's honestly kind of where my story starts um this is kind of how i came into working on this
2565920	2572640	is really that uh now you have preserved them and i just so happened to get uh recommended
2572640	2579920	um something from cosmo uh a post he made that hey we preserved all these amazing square enix games
2579920	2585760	but the one that everybody wants is uh before crisis just doesn't boot doesn't run you know
2585760	2593520	it has a lot of issues inside of the sdk emulator today and so um correct me if i'm wrong but i think prior
2593520	2601040	to uh before crisis uh nobody on the team has really tried to work on reviving any of the server
2601040	2609600	mode games or server reliant games um there so i think that's the case yeah that was the case
2609600	2618400	yeah 100 it is and so yeah i mean not to say that it's my forte but i mean i've been doing
2618400	2624720	fan translations and reverse engineering for roughly like a decade now and uh one of my ultimate goals
2624720	2630720	at the end of the day has always been to bring back a certain uh mmo called tales of attorney online
2630720	2637600	and so i've dabbled uh quite a lot into reverse engineering network protocols and um honestly
2637600	2643840	i i wanted an easier project uh for something to work on because working on mmo is kind of a next
2643840	2651120	level reverse engineering project and that's kind of where these not simple but more simplistic uh
2651120	2658320	mobile online reliant games come into place um so the first story with uh before crisis really
2658320	2662960	started with uh us just trying to get the game to boot because the second you even boot the game it
2662960	2668240	automatically goes in and and tries to make a bunch of network requests and start downloading data of
2668240	2674720	that nature and so um really trying to figure out first off uh what data it's requesting uh what type
2674720	2681440	of data is even trying to download and so um what ends up being is that just uh to start off the game
2681440	2687280	there's roughly like five to eight packets depending if that's a new uh new register person or a saved
2687280	2692960	game um that it will go through to some authentication checks make sure you have enough money to play the
2692960	2699600	game they'll start downloading some files um that are kind of like the main menu files that it needs to be
2699600	2707600	able to load the menu uh then it will get your saved data which that saved data is all encrypted as well
2707600	2712560	uh and so trying to figure out everything that this game did was just kind of a mess at first
2714000	2722080	one of the beauties of working on this though is thankfully that um we sometimes get lucky that the
2722080	2728160	games we reverse engineer for the k-type games they're not obfuscated and what that means is that
2728160	2733520	we can get in and look at the code and we have the original naming scheme of every function and that they
2733520	2738720	use to make these games and thankfully before crisis is one of those games where it was not
2739840	2745200	obfuscated in any ways that significantly speeds up the process of knowing what function is doing
2745200	2751040	what so if they name a function and it says download save well i know that function is downloading the
2751040	2756880	save data right so other games they'll be obfuscated where they'll just be a single letter character
2756880	2762320	called a capital a lowercase a capital b capital b or something like that right and so
2762320	2768800	now you have no idea what these do until you really dig deep to figure it out but uh four
2768800	2775920	crisis was nice to us in that ways so i think it was literally maybe only like a day or two it took
2775920	2781760	me to get to the main menu of the game took a bunch of figuring out how the file system worked in that
2781760	2789040	game which i know stephanie kind of spoke on regarding uh the sps before real briefly before
2789040	2797920	crisis does the same thing it chunks up the sp and stores certain types of data in the sp for example
2797920	2803680	the first slot of that sp is always the main menu data and it will never change it will always be
2803680	2809200	that thankfully unless there's a new version of that main menu data it'll always be that but as you go
2809200	2814240	down through the chunks that were allocated you find out that some chunks were reused for multiple
2814240	2820800	purposes like we have chunks that are for maps we have chunks that are for uh media we have chunks
2820800	2827680	that are for uh music things of that nature and so those constantly get overwritten deleted reused and
2827680	2833440	so we only have a limited amount of data that we actually get out of before crisis specifically
2834320	2839120	so thankfully we were lucky enough obviously to have an sp that had some data in it
2839680	2845600	so we have the main menu data which allowed me to finally get past a bunch of the network requirements
2845600	2851520	and get the game actually booting into the main menu um once figured that out we're able to realize
2851520	2857760	okay what data do we have today because that was the next problem is what data do we have once we
2857760	2864160	figured out what type of data we actually have um in the sp we were then able to realize okay
2864160	2870880	okay the last person or the last person who played this game they stopped at um the reno training
2870880	2876160	mission so they played the reno training mission and that was the last thing they ever did on that
2876160	2883440	game therefore that is the only thing we are able to get working today uh inside of before crisis and so
2884160	2891360	this is now the story of before crisis is there are roughly three to four hundred different types of
2891360	2898640	files based off of my estimates that this game needs actually have a full operating game um
2899680	2906400	unfortunately that means we need roughly three to four hundred phones worth of data and that's not
2906400	2913840	accounting for the fact that we are bound to get duplicates of the same data right and so this is kind of
2913840	2920000	where we are now trying to piece together things and trying to create our own things and that's kind of where
2920000	2926000	i've um built a lot of tools to mitigate some of these issues knowing that we're never going to be able to
2926000	2932240	make this happen um so again we originally started off with only having the reno training mission
2933120	2939520	and from there i worked with nalia to kind of figure out um he was able to give me some ideas like hey
2939520	2947360	back in the day um the beta version of this game they had a map in the shimmer hq that they actually used for the
2947360	2952720	the battle area and i was like okay that's cool he was able to provide me some tile sets for that and
2952720	2959360	i was able to fully reverse engineer how the map files work in this game um that's on a byte to
2959360	2967520	byte level so hex right and so with that knowledge i can now build our own file or game compatible map
2967520	2974080	files for before crisis and theoretically i can build any map it i could put you on mars or whatever and i
2974080	2979200	i could put you in there and it would just load it because they think that's an original um you know
2980000	2986640	before crisis file at this point because i'm the one that created it pipe for pipe perfect so yeah you're
2986640	2995280	not just preserving the game you're you're be you're able to mod it um essentially yeah i mean pretty
2995280	3001520	much that's exactly uh what i ended up having to do is uh not only just for that we now have the ability
3001520	3008720	of making our own uh material files as well so the material files um real simply they're just a bunch
3008720	3014800	of animation data with images attached to them and so um really it's just figuring out how did the
3014800	3020720	animation system work and once we kind of figure that out we can now make those and so the whole
3020720	3027120	purpose around this again wasn't that we want to mod the game it's simply that we just i knew there's no
3027120	3031920	way we're ever going to get all this data to make this a real game and so with the more dumps we get
3031920	3038080	of the game it helps me understand more about the file system structure and bite-to-bite stuff of how
3038080	3044720	these individual files work which allows me to replicate these a lot better because we have source
3044720	3050320	material well we have pictures and videos of other stuff of the game that's been documented out there
3050320	3056640	that we can pull images from or something of that nature to then be able to inject them into the game
3056640	3063360	today and um you know we've already had majority of the text already translated into english at this
3063360	3068640	point as well so once we're ready uh for that we'll make sure everybody's able to play the game
3068640	3076240	because that's obviously the next step is ensuring um all the text can be done um let's see after that
3076240	3082800	um we had made some quick discoveries that um there are two extra apps with before crisis that come
3082800	3090240	with it one we call uh extra or really it's the weapon d mode which is a completely separate like
3091120	3096880	multiplayer style mode that was made in this game kind of almost like your pokemon go style where
3096880	3100480	you would travel the world and based off depending where you were at it would kind of give you a
3100480	3106080	different um was it like a different like enemies that would show up for you to attack or something
3106080	3110960	like that in that mode and that would all change the story that happens in that mode in particular
3112000	3120000	and then we also have um the golden saucer app as well which of course is famously just a bunch of
3120000	3126960	mini games uh related to final fantasy 7 so the boxing the snow boring um what are the ones that
3126960	3133520	have in there uh trogo racing as well of course so all that stuff's kind of in there and so as we
3133520	3139440	dug through those apps and i had to again figure out uh the network protocols reverse engineer how
3139440	3145360	they even got all their data in there how they're all sent uh and we're able to find out that hey we
3145360	3152480	do have some data um for this as well so we're able to bring back the arm wrestling mini game for
3152480	3158160	the golden saucer so that's fully functional as well and we even have the cross app launching working
3158160	3163920	correctly now which is amazing so you can load into the game completely just like you originally would
3163920	3168480	you can go into the golden saucer app or it was launched the golden saucer app actually and then
3168480	3172800	you'd be able to go into the mini game play it it would save your data just like you were just playing
3172800	3179200	the game would update how many uh what your high score was put on leaderboards things of that nature so
3179200	3185440	all that stuff's working um golden saucer apps not too bad i think we need probably about 20 files
3185440	3191680	for that to actually be fully complete um roughly and then weapon d mode is going to be another chunk
3191680	3197440	of data that we probably will never get because that is a mode that is actually highly undocumented
3198000	3202480	uh again since that's kind of more of a an asymmetrical multiplayer mode as well so
3202480	3210560	yeah exactly yeah i mean it's like the if i remember correctly the weapon d mode you had
3210560	3218000	mentioned it depends on your location right so it's like if you're in for example hokkaido which is
3218000	3225680	all the way up north in japan you will correspond to like icicle in in like the actual like in-game
3225680	3231200	ff7 world you know so like there are there are some things corresponding there and i guess
3231200	3237520	other detail i wanted to add was the whole cross app launching thing um if you remember earlier i had
3237520	3243920	mentioned oi katamari damasi-kun um that that's interesting spinoff of that 2d credits mini game
3243920	3249360	and that i think was the first uh game that we had preserved that had that functionality so basically
3249360	3254400	you would have that main application and then if you wanted to access those uh those extra levels it
3254400	3259440	would launch its own app and the app had a different name and that app would have like i don't know 10
3259440	3264800	different levels and you would and you would go into that so correct me if i'm wrong uv but i think that
3264800	3269520	game might have helped you i think i guess restore that kind of cross app thing because at least you
3269520	3277920	have an example now to work off of yeah in some ways what ended up being is that the doja sdk that we
3277920	3283840	particularly use today um the way it operates and some of the calls are a little bit different from when
3283840	3289360	they're natively on a phone so we just had to modify them so they would work and yeah uh katamari
3289360	3292080	katamari damasi was kind of the one that pointed that out to us
3294800	3300400	so i think that's kind of primarily the journey of before crisis day kind of really summed up i mean
3300400	3305120	it's kind of been the game we've all been wanting to work on and you know i talk about it how
3305680	3310560	hey we have this game working people can kind of play it in some way but um it is still
3310560	3316640	we don't have it publicly available for people to actually currently play on the server and that
3316640	3321920	really comes down to a couple things which is if i make it publicly available it's great because at
3321920	3328000	least people can go see what there is um what little of there is but really it's simply the matter of the
3328000	3332880	fact that we want at least when i've talked about we want something substantial to bring out and let
3332880	3341520	people do more so than just a single mission right and so this is um where the w51h uh copy of the game
3341520	3349760	came in which is from a completely different platform um which is brew so different than doja and the
3349760	3356640	way that game had worked is uh slightly different in the matter of fact that the brew platform from
3356640	3362720	my understanding doesn't have any limitations in terms of file systems uh file storage space so
3362880	3368320	it kind of just stored things more uncompressed and actually things look better because they're not
3368320	3374240	using gifs they're actually using uh bmps so they're actually a better image format and the files
3374240	3381360	are all structurally the same but also not the same because when you look at the network side of this
3381360	3386960	game it always sends out two different type of network calls one of them i call a common network call
3386960	3393280	and one of them might call a phone specific network call so the game is very aware of what type of phone
3393280	3400160	you are using at all given times and it will only request data for that specific phone so what that
3400160	3406720	means is that there are certain file types that are cross-compatible against all phone types regardless
3406720	3414880	if they're brew um easy web or kddi or even doja or yahoo for even i think there's a yahoo version
3415440	3421760	um and then there is the phone specific ones where again those files are only meant for certain
3421760	3430160	types of phones so the w51h um has both right so in the what it doesn't have an sp but in the file
3430160	3436400	system structure itself there are common files and there are the phone specific files the common files
3436400	3441120	are great i can drag and drop them into the current system they work and load just like we normally
3441120	3446560	would want them to but when it comes to the phone specific ones which are the ones that really
3446560	3455280	matters those are like our character images are a scenario data and our um character data so that's
3455280	3461200	going to be um how many characters are on their screen with the sprites their data like how much hp
3461200	3467440	they have attack power things of that nature right so all of these are more phone specific type because
3467440	3475920	they're different image formats is primarily what it comes down to and so knowing we now had the full
3475920	3483680	chapter one my job was to find a way to convert all of those files to work on doja because that is
3483680	3490720	the server system that we have working today and the best sdk with audio support that works today as well
3492000	3498400	now i would like to say i was fully successful with that but unfortunately i'm not um we are still
3498400	3505920	at a standstill with that i was primarily able to get let's say 80 of them converted with a lot of them
3505920	3512800	working today for example the fire material spell is a phone specific thing but i was able to convert
3512800	3519680	all of those files um that are inside of this proprietary file to work with the doja so what
3519680	3525040	that means is we now have the fire material which sounds crazy but again we now have one of the three
3525040	3532720	basic materials uh available now in the game so that gives us roughly four materials we now have access to
3532720	3542480	um that work but the biggest thing holding us back now is the bruise way of handling audio files
3543200	3549680	the audio files are handled completely different uh versus doja and unfortunately what that means is that
3550320	3559120	um even with me trying to what i like to say fake the data the game will still refuse to load any
3559120	3568800	um data regarding the scenario because it does not have the appropriate audio files in place and what
3568800	3574880	that just ends up happening is that the game just will refuse to work even though i've converted everything
3574880	3581120	inside of there we just simply do not have a method today to convert the audio formats between the two
3581120	3588160	so i've reached out to a couple people uh that are way more familiar with audio stuff than i am and
3588160	3592800	they're working on something so potentially maybe in the future we'll have a way of making this work
3592800	3599760	but as of right now the only way still today to play um final fantasy before crisis is the
3600640	3606960	emulator with no body support but it's getting there um so hopefully maybe by the i would like to say
3606960	3611840	by the end of the year that we'll definitely have uh the server available so at least people can play
3611840	3614880	chapter one or the prologue uh before crisis
3617200	3622720	this is really impressive work i mean not just reverse engineering the phones but reverse
3622720	3630080	engineering how it talks over the networks and and what's what the game is expecting to get back and
3630080	3640960	um reverse engineering how the game runs and uh also being able to uh modify it like you talked about
3640960	3647440	the maps you were able to recreate maps and you could create your own maps as well this is just fantastic
3647440	3653200	work yeah i appreciate it uh you know it's definitely been a team effort right i like to say everything's
3653200	3659680	me but um obviously now yeah there's he's the he is the well of knowledge when it comes to that game
3660480	3666960	and i know he has probably 10x the passion i do for that game even though mine is pretty high as well
3667920	3673360	uh so if there's ever any information i need or it's like there's some weird tidbits of stuff that i have
3673360	3679680	to do i can ask him and he provides it to me uh case in point is you never guess but most of the text
3679680	3686720	for that game comes from the server it's not stored locally so i have to ask now yeah to go hunt uh and
3686720	3691440	give me all the text that he finds from the videos or whatever that he gets from his sources and
3692560	3700320	really shout outs also to the gentleman who provided us the dump because he had also provided us a
3700320	3707360	lot of great videos uh that i don't think anybody's ever seen of that game that helped us uh bring in
3707360	3713440	knowledge of knowing how the game even works um like i never played the game so i don't know what
3713440	3718800	happens when i click this button right what happens after that and so if i know what happens i know what
3718800	3725520	i need to give the game right but if i don't know it really makes it my job harder and so having that
3725520	3732320	footage really uh speeds things up and so yeah it's been a great work um i mean real briefly i know i'm
3732320	3737040	the server guy but uh i work on a lot of other servers for stuff as well i know we kind of
3737040	3742720	mentioned final phase seven snowboarding leaderboards uh brought that back as well there's megaman
3743600	3750480	x1 leaderboards now if i recall at that point uh even the kingdom hearts side games i'll call them
3750480	3755920	so not the coded um all the avatar kingdom mini games all have their leaderboards in function as well at
3755920	3764320	this point um and then i think my biggest next one was uh sd gundam uh generations which is quite a
3764320	3769360	complex game that we were able to get reverse engineering working but again created a full
3769360	3775200	server for that game as well uh and now that one's fully preserved 100 functional and playable today
3775200	3785360	that's amazing and do you think you would be this far if the code had been obfuscated
3787680	3797440	uh probably not but i will tell you i worked on many games now at this point that you know i'll say 75
3797440	3803680	75 of the games i work on are probably obfuscated now but i've come in just such a way of finding the
3803680	3810160	stuff the functions the data the the code that i need to find it really doesn't bother me as much
3810160	3816800	as it did at first once you've looked at the code you kind of realize how a lot of these games work
3816800	3822480	you kind of now figured a lot of it out you can kind of just assume this is how it works and you
3822480	3828560	can find it really quickly so i think sd gundam was completely obfuscated if i recall and i was able
3828560	3835440	to make that one work um and i believe uh megamen x1 was as well but a lot of the square enix games
3835440	3844320	are not obfuscated um i think the biggest offender of that if i recall is konami or their games no i
3844320	3853120	lied it's namco it's namco is a problem yes because it was uh even the tales games i was looking at
3853120	3858640	recently which uh a big thing of mine uh they're all obfuscated and just trying to figure out how to
3858640	3865680	even get past the authentication checks in those games can be super complex um unfortunately but yeah
3867360	3877040	yeah um to the uh obfuscation point um i'm kind of like java bytecode and stuff like that is kind of like
3877040	3886400	natural to me so there have been a few times where uv has come to me like hey what does this do i'm just
3886400	3893680	like oh it does this this this and this is the input this is the output and it's like oh well
3895760	3901360	yeah i should mention i really never worked in java prior to working on katai stuff i'm not a java guy
3901360	3906720	i'm primarily a dotnet person but coding is coding at the end of the day and you kind of understand it
3906720	3912480	kind of quickly once you've seen code yeah um and so i was able to catch up pretty fast but yeah i
3912480	3919120	definitely still rely upon uh 70 here sometimes for some issues that i have yeah especially around like
3919120	3925040	some of the puzzles because i know yeah there is one you had me look at and it was like
3926800	3935360	i think it was cold stuff saga that one was a pain yeah it was like 400 lines in a single method and
3935360	3939840	it had like 100 switch cases or something like all these branches inside
3943040	3953200	and uh it was like if there was zero zero and zero zero zero zero yeah i think that was the one that you
3953200	3960160	said yeah there's a lot of servers that i've worked on that are not fully released as of yet because either
3960160	3966960	i've worked on them and then found out um we don't have data to make them work which is 99 of the case
3967760	3971680	you know it ends up being just unfortunately that when you want to play the game the game immediately
3971680	3979280	requests data that we no longer have and um tails is kind of a great point um we have data on the sp
3979280	3986160	the scratch pad for it to work but immediately when you boot up the game it wants the main menu data
3986160	3993120	and unfortunately the main menu data is overwritten um so whenever the last person who played this game
3993120	3998240	they didn't go back to the main menu when they quit the game they just exited a hard exit at the game
3999040	4004960	which saved all the data from when they were in the middle of the game so unfortunately we lose that
4004960	4009040	main menu data which means we can't even get into some of these games or even play them which is
4009680	4014160	why i have probably like 30 different servers that just sit vacant doing nothing for now
4016160	4023440	nothing yet yeah nothing yet exactly exactly we got a couple games on the horizon i'm hoping i can
4023440	4028880	resurrect some servers for uh kingdom hearts code is one of them that i have a partially working server
4028880	4035120	for just simply need the sd card data for that uh and then some other nice ones coming out eventually so
4035120	4046800	fantastic again fantastic work appreciate it um so i wanted to uh as we were talking about reverse
4046800	4054560	engineering and looking into things ellen you have some interesting stories about reverse engineering
4055280	4059760	the phones and dumping the chips and and doing all kinds of things
4059760	4070080	yes so uh this year or at the end of last year i managed to successfully recruit one of my friends
4070080	4074960	to the project it's someone who had actually been hearing about the project from me for a while but
4075360	4082160	at one point i opened up a phone that happens to have an adapter a chip adapter already made to be used
4082160	4087120	in a regular chip reader and i asked if you could help me with that because i'm not really the best at
4087120	4093440	soldering once he saw what we did with that phone he thought maybe i can do this with more phones and
4093440	4100720	so it grew and it grew and it grew the process of dumping the phone chips though is is complicated
4101760	4109440	and not just technically difficult but also physically difficult so for the phones that we cannot exploit
4109440	4118080	through a usb it's necessary to find the chip on the phone that contains the data and remove it now
4118080	4126720	these are bgas bga stands for ball grid array so rather than having the legs that stick out it has a
4126720	4133200	number of solder balls underneath the chip so you would need to heat up the motherboard so much
4133200	4142640	that all of those balls heat up and can turn into liquid solder which you can then scoop off now this
4142640	4148480	requires really quite high temperatures but not too high or else you'll burn and damage the chip
4149120	4157440	so the setup is usually we've got the motherboard that's clipped on uh with some helping hands and a hot
4157440	4165680	air gun pointing straight at the phone and you're just heating it up until it's ready and you have to
4165680	4175920	successfully detach every single ball if you miss one there's a possibility you've ruined the entire chip
4176480	4187120	just by missing one if that one ball had an important data point so it is very focused very challenging
4187680	4193840	incredibly grateful that my friend cubos has even been willing to do this at all because a lot of
4193840	4200400	people have not been that's probably part of what's um why there hasn't necessarily been more
4200400	4208560	research done on these phones because this physical dumping process is so intensive then to make things
4208560	4216800	worse um all of these chips almost all of the chips have epoxy covering underneath them so there's
4216800	4226480	an epoxy covering between the chip and the motherboard um they're in they are um given the epoxy for
4226480	4234160	durability which is important for mobile devices because when they are bouncing around in your pocket
4234880	4240240	and being used in other situations unlike a computer or a console that's just going to be staying in the
4240240	4247600	same spot they're going for maximum durability the only way this epoxy can be removed is also by heating
4247600	4256560	the chip to a high temperature and removing the uh the epoxy often this means taking the soldering iron
4256560	4264080	and heating it up and very carefully scraping it off again making sure that you don't damage any of the
4264080	4271120	pads on the chip because if you damage the wrong one even if it's just one you've ruined the chip and you
4271120	4281280	can't read anything amazingly uh cubus has dumped almost close to 100 chips perhaps and has only
4281920	4289520	uh had issues with maybe one or two that's amazing this is a very high success rate an incredible success rate
4289520	4299600	um and that's only the beginning so that's just getting a chip off of the motherboard but the thing
4299600	4310240	with these chips is that a lot of them were created in a proprietary manner just for these phones so you can't
4310240	4319120	find data sheets about these chips instead there's a lot of research and reverse engineering that is
4319120	4327200	necessary where you find chips that are similar adjacent um even if they don't have quite the
4327200	4333440	right match and so when the chips are similar but not the same there's a lot of guesswork that happens
4333440	4341520	in between so when cubus makes the chip adapters they're all inferences we don't actually know how
4341520	4347600	it's going to work until it's plugged in oftentimes there will be one wire that actually needs to go somewhere
4347600	4354960	else so you'll see lots of wire soldered on top of the adapter to connect various pins to one another
4354960	4363920	also um cutting various traces and such so why do we need the adapters it's because the most affordable
4363920	4375840	chip readers use a 48 pin dip dip zip socket let me say that again 48 pin dip zip socket so um the a lot of
4375840	4381920	the adapters that can read these chips directly the chip readers cost literally thousands of dollars
4383520	4391200	the chip readers that have this 48 pin sockets are more like 100 200 something that someone could
4391200	4398880	reasonably afford as a hobbyist so the adapters are designed to translate various chip pinouts to that
4398880	4408720	format um to add another layer to this many of the chips are multi-chip packages so they're combining
4408720	4417440	nor nand sram dram into one package with shared lines which makes it difficult to identify pin functions
4417440	4422880	or avoid conflicts without a data sheet but of course we don't have data sheets for a lot of these chips
4422880	4430160	so special care has to be taken with this with like the chip enable lines to prevent multiple dies from
4430160	4436960	outputting data simultaneously which is going to result in unreadable data and sometimes it's almost
4436960	4443840	unavoidable to deal with this if they happen to share the same there are some situations where so many things
4443840	4451120	are shared the data is just kind of garbled so cubus has had to dump multiple times and then we have to
4451120	4457200	piece the different parts of the dump together where some of it got garbled but some of it didn't and
4457200	4464240	then another one where a different part got garbled but the part garbled in the first one was clean
4466400	4474240	it reminds me of the floppy disk dumping that we do where we use flux technology and we you you can have
4474880	4485120	a floppy disk that is somewhat broken or damaged and you can copy uh the data from another of a uh another
4485120	4494960	copy of the same floppy disk so similar um mindset of preserving it there i love it piecing it together
4494960	4500240	and i haven't even i actually haven't finished the whole list of problems that occur when trying to dump
4500240	4508320	these phones another issue that comes up is with the budget chip readers themselves um most commercial
4508320	4516160	chip readers are limited by fixed reading algorithms and timing and so if the chip reader does not have
4516160	4523680	the algorithm that matches the chip you can't use it you just can't dump it so what happens in that case
4523680	4529920	well one of the things that cubus has been working on more recently is diy solutions using an arduino
4530880	4537680	to be able to read these chips they offer more flexibility but are slower and also require
4537680	4544720	additional components such as level shifters which sometimes need to be applied very carefully by hand
4544720	4545520	too many legs
4548080	4554000	and so ultimately the work requires a good deal of engineering effective work
4554000	4560480	and a very delicate handiwork to get a chance at extracting data
4562960	4572160	so one of the challenges that i don't think me or cubus expected when we went into dumping a lot of
4572160	4583520	these chips was a not a lot of support and feedback from other people knowledgeable in technical
4583520	4589200	engineering the way that conversations will usually go is we will talk about these chips how they are
4589200	4593920	proprietary how the data sheets don't exist so people and people say no they must exist they have
4593920	4599120	to exist like why would that not exist once we get past that point of proving yes this stuff is
4599120	4604400	isn't there they get to the point of well why are you wasting so much time trying to dump this very
4604400	4605120	obscure chip
4608240	4617280	what's the point i guess that's the way to i don't know um and so it's been difficult to recruit other
4617280	4623760	people who might have knowledge of this because there seem to be some some strange preconceptions
4623760	4633120	questions about the worth of a project that is this difficult um i think that in the conversation
4633120	4640080	that we're having here in this podcast the value of this is obvious we have been able to exploit
4640080	4646560	significantly more phones the usb directly because of many chip duns that was that was uh done by cubus
4646560	4655120	in order for exploits to be found you need a sample firmware a sample of the bootloader
4656080	4661920	so unless we have a chip dump we're going in completely blind and it's basically impossible to figure
4661920	4667840	out an exploit these chip dumps have allowed us to not go in blind we have been able to dump a wider variety
4667840	4675280	of phones we can now dump at least one phone from every single dokuma manufacturer at this point
4676400	4679600	we have a method for all of them which has been amazing
4681840	4687200	uh so i hope that there can be more interest and support in the hardware side
4687840	4691600	um well i hope that for everything the hacking side the hardware side there's just
4691600	4698320	it's that's a pretty small group of people who even know about all this stuff um but it's such a
4698320	4705200	fascinating and interesting challenge for people who might be wondering what they can do to use their
4705200	4713680	skills in a new and inventive manner for people who are looking to explore a realm where unlike a lot of
4713680	4721280	the other retro consoles the nintendo consoles the sega consoles sony uh etc etc it is really a lot of
4721280	4727600	unexplored technical territory and we are making new and amazing discoveries every day and i think
4727600	4733920	that's a good segue into what max is going to talk about with regards to the sideloading
4736480	4740880	yeah yeah definitely and i think the way you put it just before i go to sideloading i think the way
4740880	4746800	you stated that was really is really good because yeah it's not just against the the technical hurdles
4746800	4750800	right but it's also just a lot of preconceived notions against these games in general
4750800	4756560	because as we all know in the west flip phone games really were like snake you know people
4756560	4761040	always kind of stop at snake you know or really crappy flip phone games that run at like two frames
4761040	4767040	a second so when i so when you go up to somebody and say i'm preserving games on japanese flip phones
4767040	4770960	the first thing that comes to their mind is like oh it's snake it's crap it's not worth preserving
4771680	4777360	but well firstly all games deserve to be preserved obviously you know there's no i mean even the bad ones
4777360	4783520	right but it as we've seen in this podcast and the two previous ones there are so many gems on japanese
4783520	4788320	feature phones and all of them and there really were the precursors to modeled mobile games as we know
4788320	4793760	them especially in the way they were distributed they were distributed digitally a lot of them use the
4793760	4800160	subscription-based distribution models where new content was delivered monthly or sometimes weekly to
4800160	4806640	these games and that's not dissimilar from how server-reliant mobile games are today so in a sense
4806640	4812320	that these games are really like they're important in gaming history mobile gaming history at large
4812320	4816880	and that's why all of us here have been you know doing our best to raise awareness about these games so
4816880	4822880	i really do appreciate that point but back to what you were saying about side loading so the user xyz who
4822880	4829360	was the one who figured out this well he was he was one of two people who figured out this non-destructive
4830320	4837040	dumping method through this debug cable he figured out that on certain later devices i think it's like
4837040	4845040	the second to last panasonic imode phone ever created uh the p01f he discovered that with the debug cable
4845040	4851600	um obviously the specifics are above my head but he realized that you can side load um games onto this by
4851600	4856480	basically tricking the phone that it's a pre-installed application because on dokomo phones
4856480	4863520	in particular pre-installed apps and games don't require a sim card to run but if you have a paid
4863520	4868640	game you have to have the original sim card that you bought the game with or else the game refuses to
4868640	4874080	launch now of course when you run that through the dokomo sdk that verification is not there because
4874080	4879040	it's not on the phone but if you do want to play the game on the phone basically what xyz did was just
4879040	4884800	say okay for example i don't know rockman.exe fanta network i'm going to put it on the phone but the
4884800	4890320	phone's going to think it's pre-installed so it's not going to ask for that verification and in doing
4890320	4896000	so we were able to sideload games onto basically original hardware for the first time now there are
4896000	4901200	some limitations for some reason that there's no gyroscope inside of this which means that the motion
4901200	4907360	control games don't work they just kind of glitch out and it's possible to sideload games with sd card
4907360	4913840	data but it's it's kind of a convoluted process but it is possible but if there's one game that i
4913840	4918240	do want to highlight that's sideloadable and actually the the experience is elevated through
4918240	4924720	sideloading it it's a game that we preserved not even a week ago um is uh it's called real zero
4924720	4930000	another edition and real zero well zero the series is actually better known as fatal frame
4930880	4936160	actually no yeah yeah fatal frame yes and in the west and basically the whole thing about that
4936160	4940160	series is oh you have a camera and you take a picture of a ghost and ah scary ghost
4940160	4946640	you know so basically though they this is in 2004 they say wait a minute what if we made a game
4946640	4951920	for keitai that utilized the camera and you take a picture of an object and the ghost shows up and
4951920	4957120	then on like using the picture you took as the background you kind of immersively try to destroy
4957120	4963440	the ghost and that's exactly what we did we found a trial version of that and incubus preserved it
4963440	4972160	and from a chip dump mainly and basically what this this game does is um it looks for like a image
4972160	4976800	that's bright enough so i either for my for my demo i had to like point it out of like a light source
4976800	4982400	basically you know to make it be happy then the ghost shows up and then you you kill the ghost and
4982400	4987440	then it takes you to like a fake phone menu like they built a little mini phone menu inside there and
4987440	4992640	there are emails fake emails from the game and these emails are saying stuff like oh there are ghosts
4992640	4997040	around i'm so scared you know like i wonder what would happen if i took my camera out right now
4997040	5003040	dot dot dot you know but basically the demo ends at that point but there were 60 ghosts available for
5003040	5008160	that game and basically it's like that's an experience that you can you can play it through
5008160	5012400	the emulator you can select an image from your computer and load it but i think having it side
5012400	5016880	loadable and be able to take the picture yourself i think it's just a really cool experience
5016880	5023840	yeah and if i can add on to that like there are a bunch of these dojo phones that have you know
5024480	5033280	gyroscopes camera you know gps some of them have extra buttons other ones can detach and the sdk
5033280	5038720	emulator just can't do that so at least for scroll jamie i'm hoping to get all those kind of
5039360	5046800	control sets in because you know we have all those kind of controls now so it's just
5047360	5053440	the only way to like truly play those games is to sideload you know so
5055360	5063360	and i guess it's kind of like you have the eye toy and the wiimote you have those games that you're
5063360	5070960	never going to see on like the switch or something because like it uses that one thing that just
5070960	5074560	you know nothing ever uses
5077200	5083360	this is uh again i've said it many times during this podcast this is just amazing work by everyone
5083360	5091040	involved and i'm so so happy that you all took the time here today to talk about your your work your
5091040	5101360	progress your your chips your phones uh your javas uh your everything so we're gonna uh wrap up this
5101360	5109920	podcast here uh and as we do that i would like to invite you all to tell the audience tell our
5109920	5115200	listeners here where they can find you what you're looking to work on next and how people can help you
5115200	5122640	out in whatever endeavors that you're looking to uh continue on we can start with uh uv
5124960	5130800	yeah i appreciate it um i mean you can follow me blue sky twitter on uv app for both of those uh
5130800	5136480	or primarily just discord uh i mean the ktai wiki is the best way to probably get a hold of me um
5136480	5142800	primarily i mean if you need me for anything just mention me uh right now we're just doing a lot of
5142800	5147520	stuff with a new launcher not sure if everybody's aware of that but we've made it a lot easier for
5147520	5153280	people to play the games um so that definitely helps but doing some troubleshooting debugging and
5153280	5158800	so um great to be here thank you so much for inviting me especially as kind of being the new guy
5158800	5163840	here um it's been a it's been a thrill and a blast to be able to be a part of this journey so thanks
5165680	5175920	fantastic uh stephanie uh yeah so um i'm on blue sky as a zero shadow tail i'm also on mastodon
5175920	5186480	which is a zero shadow tail at chitter dot xyz because i'm squirrel so but i'm also in the ktai
5186480	5193040	wiki discord and there's also the squirrel jamie discord as well and there's an irc there's an irc channel
5193040	5205680	too if you like irc still but uh i'll be continuing working on basically the on nanocoat getting that
5205680	5212960	working getting that online and obviously you know they'll be testing things running things and you know
5212960	5226720	basically if you can break it then i can fix it but yeah thank you for having me here and it's been
5226720	5233760	you know really really great and i enjoyed it thank you thank you thank you ellen
5233760	5243840	so for me um there are a few things like uh like uh stephanie mentioned we have ktai wiki the ktai
5243840	5250560	wiki is a website and a wiki but we have a discord that is attached or associated with the wiki and
5250560	5256400	that's where a lot of the community is and that's where a lot of the brainstorming and invention
5256400	5262320	and reverse engineering is happening so that would be the best place for anyone interested
5262320	5269440	in japanese feature phones to go additionally i have some social media accounts under the username
5269440	5275920	unabandoned where where i post some content so i have unabandoned where on blue sky unabandoned where
5275920	5283200	on youtube and most recently unabandoned where on tiktok where i just shared a video of a panasonic
5283200	5291040	po1a that got over 500 000 views still blows my mind i don't know that's wild that's why it's a
5291040	5295840	very cool phone though if any of you happen to have a tiktok and want to see the video it is
5296560	5301920	it's a fascinating phone the hardware of these phones in addition to the software it was just amazing
5304880	5311920	awesome and last but not least max yeah so i'm not as cool as ellen i don't have a tiktok
5311920	5318800	despite being in the age demographic but i am on twitter and blue sky under uh my username rockman
5318800	5326080	cosmo i'm also on discord under the same username and yeah i mean if for future things i want to do
5326080	5331280	this year it really is just expanding you know the outreach raising more awareness and that's always
5331280	5338240	what i've been about so like i said in the past year in august i presented at an academic conference
5338240	5343760	but also at the strong museum of play on keita game preservation i like to say it was one of the
5343760	5348640	best four days of my life i got to meet jonas i got to meet ellen and it was just such a special
5348640	5353520	experience and i really got to see like how much interest there is in these games not just from game
5353520	5357920	preservationists but also academics because apparently this is an academic field that just
5357920	5361120	no one's discussing even the japanese themselves they're shocked that i care
5361120	5367680	so i am definitely gonna over the next year i'm probably gonna try to do more of those things and
5367680	5374400	maybe the next podcast a secret bigger project that might talk about but um but yeah other than that
5374400	5380000	if you do want to help out like ellen said yeah please go to keitaiwiki.com and join the discord
5380800	5385600	you don't have to be a technical mastermind to help us if you know of a lost keita game that does not
5385600	5391200	have an entry on keitai wiki yet which there are a lot then feel free to make an entry there and yeah
5391760	5396960	basically to just yeah please help us out and once again thank you so much jonas and hit save for
5396960	5404160	having us on really appreciate it thank you max and again thank you everyone for being on the show today
5405120	5411440	this is super fun i love doing this and i look forward to more of these updates as you continue to
5411440	5418960	progress i want to say thank you to all our listeners and if you want to reach out to anyone
5418960	5424480	here of course reach out to them immediately directly on the keita wiki and you can also stop
5424480	5431120	by the hit save discord and chat with us there thank you all and have a fantastic rest of your day
5431120	5436640	see you next time bye bye
