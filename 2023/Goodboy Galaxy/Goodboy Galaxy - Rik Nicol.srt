00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,850
Hello everyone and welcome to yet another Hit Save podcast.

2
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,570
I'm here with Rick Nickel of Good Boy Galaxy and you just saw the Good Boy Galaxy trailer

3
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,590
that just came out like two weeks ago here.

4
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,090
The latest one.

5
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,910
It's really, really fun.

6
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,610
Really fun game, first of all.

7
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,230
Super cool trailer.

8
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,410
And I love the music.

9
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,410
So hi Rick.

10
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,450
Hi Rick.

11
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,290
Do you want to introduce yourself?

12
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:13,890
Yeah.

13
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,390
Hi, I'm Rick from Good Boy Galaxy.

14
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,590
And yeah, I'm more on the creative side.

15
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,030
And with my friend Jeremy, we've been working on Good Boy Galaxy for the past couple of

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,270
years.

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,510
So tell me a bit about Good Boy Galaxy.

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,630
What is it?

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,950
So it's a exploration-based platform game.

20
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,010
I'm a bit hesitant to call it a Metroidvania because I don't think it really checks all

21
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,430
the boxes.

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,170
But it's kind of in the same vein a little bit.

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,190
And yeah, it's a platform adventure game for the Game Boy Advance.

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,230
So a new game for the Game Boy Advance being made in this year of 2023.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,310
What made you think of this?

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,490
What made you go into making a Game Boy game in 2023?

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,630
Or even a few years earlier?

28
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:10,790
Yeah.

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,810
Well, we started it as a game jam project.

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,010
So it was just a small weekend project.

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:29,050
And I think it was for the Ludum Dare game jam.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,970
And we just wondered, could we do it in such a short time frame?

33
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:45,510
And we just about, to the very last hour, which is game jam tradition, did manage to

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:53,670
pull off a playable game that had a couple of levels and an end that actually run on

35
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,850
the Game Boy Advance.

36
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,090
And of course, that made us overconfident.

37
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,270
So we thought, it's easy, we can do this.

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,910
And yeah, there was not much prior thought behind it.

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,170
But it just felt like a fun thing to do.

40
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,670
And it was a fun thing to do.

41
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,250
We really enjoyed doing it.

42
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,110
And the Game Boy Advance is just super special to us.

43
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,690
So it felt right.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,650
And also with the kind of gratuitous, it was the 20th anniversary of the Game Boy Advance

45
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,290
just recently.

46
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,290
So it kind of lined up with that as well.

47
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,930
So everything just kind of seemed in alignment at the time.

48
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,970
But there wasn't really a special reason.

49
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,770
It was just kind of, we thought it was fun.

50
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,830
We thought it was interesting.

51
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:46,330
And we didn't run into any very difficult obstacles that made us give up.

52
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,130
So that's the reason, really.

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,090
Awesome.

54
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,550
So I want to show the picture here is of a GBA running your game.

55
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,390
And this is my favorite form factor of the GBA.

56
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,850
I know a lot of people will maybe disagree.

57
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,810
But I think this is just a fantastic, iconic, handheld console.

58
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,110
The amount of effort that you put into the game, as I was playing the beta release that

59
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,090
you sent over to us, thank you so much for providing that.

60
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,570
I was just amazed by the animations, the artwork.

61
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,130
It's so colorful.

62
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,250
It's really, really fun to play.

63
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,990
And as you said, exploratory, just exploring the different areas and going back and trying

64
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,610
new, different things, dying a lot.

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,790
It's just so much fun.

66
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,250
So how did you get into this?

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,610
What's your background in game development?

68
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,570
And how did you get to where you are right now developing this?

69
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,670
Because it's a very polished game.

70
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,470
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,690
So I guess earlier in my career, I was working in web development and a bit of print design.

72
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:18,650
But I was always doing kind of small freelance things or hobby things, mainly pixel art for

73
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,710
mobile games and stuff like that.

74
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,830
So that was my background.

75
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:35,090
And then a few years ago, six years ago, I moved to the Netherlands to work at a mobile

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,950
game studio called Lucky Cat.

77
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,490
And that's where I met Jeremy.

78
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,250
So we had a few years, a couple of years working together there, too.

79
00:05:48,190 --> 00:06:00,710
And I think it's really when I developed my skill set a bit more because we were doing

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,910
like 40 something prototypes a year.

81
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,610
Like it's a crazy amount of projects.

82
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,310
So it was just like nonstop learning.

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,230
And yeah, that's how I got into it.

84
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,270
And that's where I met Jeremy.

85
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,570
He's also from England, but we both met in the Netherlands.

86
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,330
Just a short jump over the puddle.

87
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,650
Yeah, very short.

88
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,250
They're surprisingly similar countries.

89
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:40,130
But yeah, we did a couple of game jams in the weekends.

90
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,610
And yeah, this was one of them.

91
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,630
You said you did about 40 projects a year plus game jams during the weekend.

92
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,070
Yeah.

93
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,590
That sounds like a lot of innovation, a lot of trying new things.

94
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:06,570
Yeah, it is kind of, it's like a, it's something that you practice and kind of get good at.

95
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,730
But I'm hesitant to call it its own skill because actually the skill is just,

96
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,030
it's kind of like just accepting the idea that comes to you and just doing it and not interrogating it too much.

97
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,450
And then you discover things along the way.

98
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:36,530
But yeah, that's definitely had a relatively big part in this project coming about.

99
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:48,050
What were some of the other game jam projects that you tried out but didn't feel like it had legs to stand on its own, such as Good Boy Galaxy?

100
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:58,750
The one other game jam that I did with Jeremy was, it was called Super Bike Strike.

101
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,070
Super Bike Strike?

102
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,710
Yeah, it was kind of like a side-scrolling shoot-em-up.

103
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:15,110
But the interesting thing was you'd jump from your ship, which is actually a hover bike,

104
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,790
and then you'd land on the other person's bike and like punch them off.

105
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,810
And then their bike would like fall down and smash into other bikes.

106
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,370
So you could have quite a chain reaction.

107
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:38,370
And there was like a bit of a double jump to save you from just immediately falling down.

108
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:46,190
It's that little bit of gameplay, the bit where you jump and attack,

109
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,650
is super satisfying when you actually land on the bike, that you intend to.

110
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,750
But we did run into some trouble.

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,690
It's actually a little bit more difficult than you want it to be.

112
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:08,870
And one of the caveats to the difficulty is the game is actually more difficult

113
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,290
the fewer enemies are around, which is actually inverse what you expect.

114
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,630
But it also ramps up the challenge in other ways that way, because you've got more people shooting at you.

115
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,930
So it's very difficult to get the balance right.

116
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,370
And to get the game feel to good, it had to be quite fast and quite zoomed in.

117
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,710
But that also made it more difficult to land where you want.

118
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:42,110
And I think the idea's got legs, but I think it'd have to be done maybe in 3D or something

119
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,250
to make it a bit more user-friendly, I guess.

120
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,970
But yeah, that's the previous game jam that we did before Good Boy.

121
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,650
That sounds really cool too. I would love to try that out.

122
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,670
I'll send you a link afterwards.

123
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,890
Fantastic.

124
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,350
So Good Boy Galaxy was thought up as a game jam project during a weekend.

125
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,870
How did you go about after the game jam?

126
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,490
What was your thought process like?

127
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,930
Like, okay, maybe we should do something here.

128
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,470
How did you go about actually doing something?

129
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,590
You ran a Kickstarter. I definitely want to dive into that as well.

130
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,390
Yeah, so we didn't really think about the Kickstarter for quite a long time.

131
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,290
We were just working on it a weekend a month or something, just here and there.

132
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,870
And then I think it's when COVID hit, everyone was working from home

133
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,350
and suddenly had their commute time.

134
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:52,690
And there was less to do.

135
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,850
So we got more done.

136
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,150
And that's when we were getting the demo that ended up launching the Kickstarter.

137
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,310
So yeah, we got the demo ready.

138
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:18,530
And then we just decided to make it a full...

139
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,950
At that point, it was quite obvious that it was worth pursuing.

140
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,530
But when it was just the game jam version, it was just a little side hobby.

141
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,150
It wasn't that interesting.

142
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,730
But at the point when the demo was taking shape

143
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,670
is when we decided to take it to Kickstarter.

144
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,890
So what was your experience with Kickstarter?

145
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:58,050
We'd partnered with First Press to publish the physical copies

146
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,350
before we did the Kickstarter.

147
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,170
And they'd done a few other Kickstarters before.

148
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,250
So we kind of knew a little bit what to expect.

149
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:20,790
So yeah, basically, the deal was we had a limited amount that we could sell.

150
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,790
And then basically, we didn't really have to pay for it.

151
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,130
It was kind of like an advance.

152
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,290
So that's why it's limited.

153
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,410
So that it's safe for all parties.

154
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,890
But of course, we blew through the whole thing in the first day,

155
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,470
which nobody really expected.

156
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,630
And then people were angry about it.

157
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,590
And we were kind of unprepared for it.

158
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,750
So it's a bit stressful, to be honest.

159
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,750
And of course, we're both still working.

160
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,710
We kind of wanted, or we kind of expected,

161
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,670
it to be a bit of a continuation of a side Hollywood project.

162
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,410
But when you have a Kickstarter that successful,

163
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,430
you're kind of responsible to fulfil your biggest promises.

164
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,890
So it was kind of a mix, mixed emotions.

165
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,390
I was also finding it difficult to sleep with all that going on.

166
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,670
So it's like heightening the emotions of the excitement and the stress.

167
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,650
But I mean, it was definitely a very overall positive experience.

168
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:44,290
And it was definitely super grateful for everyone that's backed the project

169
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,790
and given us this opportunity to make the game exactly as we really want to.

170
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,990
And not just cutting corners and doing it here and there.

171
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,730
So yeah, hopefully they're happy with their decision

172
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,690
when they finally get to play the game.

173
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,530
Yeah, what I've seen so far from the game,

174
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,610
I definitely think that people are going to be very, very happy with the end result.

175
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,110
Again, I am amazed by the animation, the colour.

176
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,030
It pops, it really, really pops.

177
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,790
The music is really solid.

178
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,150
So what is your role within the game?

179
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,330
And what's Jeremy's role in the game?

180
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,990
Yeah, so I guess the trouble is we both do a bit of everything.

181
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,770
But from my side, it's mainly creative stuff, all the art and animation.

182
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,330
And a lot of the game design, I guess, comes from my side.

183
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,930
And then from Jeremy's side, he's like the technical guy.

184
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:04,270
He's set up the project, all the programming, his remit.

185
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,970
And making sure it compiles, fixing bugs,

186
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,290
tracking down the most esoteric thing that you can possibly imagine

187
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,750
in the Game Boy Advance's hardware.

188
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,230
But yeah, there's definitely some overlap.

189
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,710
I've also done a lot of coding myself,

190
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,530
like a lot of the fancy effects in the backgrounds

191
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,610
and all the quests and stuff.

192
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,470
A lot of that's me. Sometimes it has to be fixed.

193
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,630
And then music, we've both kind of done.

194
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:45,190
Also Vincent Perger, aka Tui, did a lot of the music in the game.

195
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,330
But yeah, me and Jeremy both like doing music too.

196
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,390
So we've both had a hand in that.

197
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,510
And then level design, we've also both done.

198
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,730
We have slightly different philosophies when it comes to level design.

199
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:12,750
So Jeremy makes the most clever and cruel Mario Maker levels

200
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,430
that you've ever played and that are very difficult,

201
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,210
but very clever mechanically.

202
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:29,410
And from my design background and from all the time working on mobile games,

203
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,530
I've very much got the mindset of simplification,

204
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,070
making everything move.

205
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,250
So it's interesting.

206
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,830
We've worked collaboratively on the levels

207
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,110
and we're both making passives over each other's work

208
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,730
until eventually we've got something that's...

209
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,050
We like to think of it as a bit of cake and eating it too,

210
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,970
because we've got the clever ideas,

211
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,950
but hopefully there's less frustration.

212
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,790
I don't want to sound the corners off completely,

213
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,510
but we've tried to make it so that there's no showstoppers

214
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,570
if you get completely stuck.

215
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,650
But yeah, that's where we're at.

216
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,210
You mentioned that there are some quirks

217
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,110
when it comes to programming for the GBA.

218
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,610
What are some challenges that you have met and overcome,

219
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,850
or at least tried to overcome?

220
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,890
It's a relatively advanced...

221
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,610
You'll forgive the pun.

222
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,570
It's got the feeling like it's a SNES or a Mega Drive or a Genesis,

223
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,390
but it's actually a lot more powerful.

224
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,190
So it's a lot freer than you'd imagine,

225
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,590
or you might imagine it would be,

226
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,270
but there's still some tight restrictions.

227
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,270
There's only a finite amount of layers.

228
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,230
There's only four layers, I think.

229
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:20,330
And we work in four bits per pixel, I think,

230
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,690
which is 15 colours per spline or per tile.

231
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,630
Yeah, there's a lot of clever tricks

232
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,270
to try and get the absolute most out of it.

233
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,550
Like with the layers,

234
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,180
sometimes we split them into sections

235
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,790
so that we can scroll one layer at different speeds,

236
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,390
depending on where it is,

237
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,870
to get the feeling of more depth

238
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,870
and constantly running a lot of...

239
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,510
So from the art side, I really want to make the levels feel unique

240
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,250
and have lots of areas within them

241
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,030
that feel not quite set piece,

242
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,710
but at least so you know where you are,

243
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,830
because you can go through the level in several different ways.

244
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,050
It's important to have landmarks,

245
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,690
but that's expensive when you can only have so many tiles in memory.

246
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,550
So we went through incredible lengths

247
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,670
of automatically figuring out

248
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,710
which tiles are similar enough to be collapsed into one tile.

249
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,870
We can keep them...

250
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,970
We can flip and mirrored versions of the tiles

251
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,510
don't count as an extra tile.

252
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,890
So we have lots of clever use of that.

253
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,650
That's smart.

254
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,970
Yeah, there's so many really...

255
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,790
quite arduous tasks that end up just shaving enough off

256
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,410
that you can do what you actually wanted to do in the first place,

257
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,010
which is super important on the low-end consoles.

258
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,330
But obviously when we do the switch port,

259
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,510
which we're just starting now,

260
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,950
it's probably all this stuff is no longer necessary.

261
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,170
But it was fun, little puzzles to figure out.

262
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,910
So I enjoyed it anyway.

263
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,550
That's awesome.

264
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,390
So we've gone quite deep into the technical weeds already.

265
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,670
So I want to bring us back up a bit

266
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,190
and talk about the game itself

267
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,650
and the story in the game, the characters.

268
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,070
So tell us a bit about who you are as a player

269
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,190
and what the mission is, the story is.

270
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,770
Okay. So the background of the game

271
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:03,170
or the overarching story is that you're this dog

272
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,390
named Maxwell.

273
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,530
He's not a dog from Earth.

274
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,230
He's a dog from the dog galaxy, obviously.

275
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:18,570
And his system or his planet is dying

276
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,050
or collapsing or in trouble.

277
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,670
So being the good boy that he is,

278
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,750
he takes it on himself to use his hyperdrive

279
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,410
to blast to a whole new system

280
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,450
with no idea if he's going to find anything

281
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,150
or find advanced civilization that could help him.

282
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,270
It's a big risk, basically.

283
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,330
So he goes ahead and does that.

284
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,170
And then he has to use every single jump

285
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,690
at his availability.

286
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,070
So now he's completely stranded in this new galaxy.

287
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,630
But he has found life, civilization and such.

288
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,530
But yeah, so it's his job now to figure out a way home

289
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,550
and also figure out if there's someone

290
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,210
that can actually help him in his original mission.

291
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,470
Yeah, the reason we did it like this is we wanted

292
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,750
to really emphasize exploration and discovery,

293
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,790
I guess is the right word.

294
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,510
So having Maxwell also be discovering this at the same time

295
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,890
as the player made the most sense to us.

296
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,270
One of our mantras when deciding and designing the worlds

297
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,770
and stuff was the word surprise.

298
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:03,150
So we really wanted there to be unexpected things

299
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,670
to find when you're exploring stuff.

300
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,810
And the best way we felt to go about that was

301
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,670
to make everything unexpected in the sense that it's all alien

302
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,290
to you, the player, and also to the character

303
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,130
that you're playing as.

304
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,090
The exploration, I mentioned earlier here that I died a lot.

305
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,510
But it doesn't feel punishing.

306
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,690
It's more like, yes, I know why I perished here.

307
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,610
Because I was doing something that I shouldn't.

308
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,690
So then I try again, and I die, and I try again, and I die.

309
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,230
And then eventually I figure out, oh, no, wait, this is the way I'm going about this.

310
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,650
I really like the quick return

311
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,350
to where you were so you can try it again.

312
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,490
It's a very forgiving gameplay, I would say,

313
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,990
even though it's hard at times.

314
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,130
It's very forgiving.

315
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,250
And it's super, super fun.

316
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,490
I love the interactions

317
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,830
between the good boy here, Maxwell,

318
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,650
and the characters that he meets.

319
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,210
Because it's super funny.

320
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,170
It's really well written.

321
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,670
I think it's on the second world.

322
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,330
I don't want to spoil the surprise, but you get locked in

323
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,570
a little for a bit.

324
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,830
And I was not prepared for that at all.

325
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,770
I was like, oh, wait, this is very different.

326
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,970
And you have to fight your way out.

327
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,330
It's really, really fun.

328
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:00,330
And I love that, as you said, the environment is alien.

329
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,750
So you're exploring as well as Maxwell

330
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,710
and just finding things out and learning about the environment.

331
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,210
It's super, super fun.

332
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:12,910
Thank you very much.

333
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,910
So you said you go off the theme of surprise.

334
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,050
So how do you plan for surprises?

335
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,070
It's a good question.

336
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,510
I think surprise is maybe too strong a word.

337
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,890
But it's what we told ourselves.

338
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,350
So we ask with it.

339
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:35,930
I like it.

340
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,550
I think, yeah, how we dealt with this

341
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,550
was mainly me and my friend Andreas.

342
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,650
And Andreas is a guy that I met in London

343
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,310
when I lived there.

344
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,070
And he's this super chill dude.

345
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,850
And he's super creative.

346
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,470
Kind of like Jake the dog from Adventure Time.

347
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,110
So basically we'd have these long chats.

348
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,990
And Andreas was working on concept art with me.

349
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,930
So we were kind of coming up with a lot of these ideas together.

350
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,610
I think if I was coming up with everything on my own,

351
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,390
I don't know.

352
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,890
I couldn't really surprise myself.

353
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,690
Or I couldn't really have that sense of wonder.

354
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,870
So when we were collaborating,

355
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,250
it was super important because I knew what was

356
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,190
what would grab my sense of wonder

357
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,030
or my attention.

358
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,930
And we'd figure out a way to combine our ideas

359
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,290
and workshop things.

360
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,210
So yeah, we basically just had

361
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,910
just conversations where we were talking about

362
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,330
broad ideas and then just

363
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,350
going away, sketching things out,

364
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,990
coming up with random...

365
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,450
Sometimes it would be a visual design

366
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,210
and then we'd come up with the lore behind it.

367
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,870
And sometimes it'd be we had a vague idea

368
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,410
of what kind of a character

369
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,930
and then one of us would go and draw it

370
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,050
and then we'd develop it a bit more.

371
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,810
But yeah, I think there was a bit of back and forth

372
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,010
between us that really...

373
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,350
That's basically how we planned for Surprise,

374
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,850
was by surprising each other.

375
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,430
I think that's a really good method.

376
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,130
It seems to have worked really well.

377
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,970
I definitely was surprised

378
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,250
by the piece that I'm playing,

379
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,870
the parts that I've been playing.

380
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,890
And yeah, it's just, again, super, super fun.

381
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,750
So how did you get into game development?

382
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,290
What was it that drove you to start

383
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,110
with game development all these years ago?

384
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,710
Yes, I guess I was always kind of

385
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,230
interested in it.

386
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,070
I grew up with like an 8-bit Atari.

387
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,770
And yeah, I just...

388
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,570
I was always sketching ideas for games

389
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,830
and trying my best to program in BASIC.

390
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,510
And yeah, it's been something

391
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,010
that I've been doing for my whole life, basically.

392
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,910
So it's really hard to pinpoint a specific moment.

393
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,730
But I think a lot of those older games,

394
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,990
they're kind of...

395
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:54,830
They kind of have an alien, otherworldly feel to them

396
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,570
a little bit by accident,

397
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,350
because they often didn't...

398
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,510
It wasn't normal yet to have an artist involved in the game.

399
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,810
So it was abstract to the point of absurdity.

400
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,190
In some cases.

401
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,690
And yeah, it felt something separate to real life.

402
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,890
Whereas games now, obviously,

403
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,410
some of them are very realistic

404
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:21,810
and feel almost like a movie or a dream or something.

405
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,630
Whereas some of those older games

406
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,210
seemed to be almost like this whole separate thing to reality.

407
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,550
And I think that really...

408
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,590
It really affected my imagination, I guess,

409
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,230
because it just really made you want to fill in the details

410
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,050
and come up with your own other worlds.

411
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,230
So yeah, for me, it's almost like it's been there since day one.

412
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,050
I've just finally gone out on my own

413
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,910
and made something that's more my own

414
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,570
rather than working for hire on other people's projects.

415
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,510
And for Jeremy, I think it's similar.

416
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,370
He grew up with consoles

417
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,110
rather than quite the old-man computers that I had.

418
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,350
And yeah, he's been, like I said,

419
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,630
working on Mario Maker levels and this kind of thing.

420
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,230
So for him, I think it's...

421
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,450
Yeah, I think it's a similar thing.

422
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,690
It's something that we've kind of grown up with,

423
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,590
but just from slightly different perspectives.

424
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,410
Cool.

425
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,550
So, Good Boy Galaxy is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.

426
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,970
You also mentioned Nintendo Switch port.

427
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,010
What else will it be on?

428
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,050
There's an Evercade version that's also announced, I think.

429
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:03,390
I'm not 100% sure when that one's shipping.

430
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,310
I think it might be December.

431
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,170
So similar time to the Game Boy Advance version.

432
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,550
And then we've got the Switch version and the PC version,

433
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,050
which we're doing now.

434
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,130
We're trying to add a little extra to that.

435
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,970
So we're trying to add some local co-op missions.

436
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,270
So it's going to take a little bit longer,

437
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,850
but hopefully not too much longer.

438
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,150
The Switch one is a bit of a question mark.

439
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:40,090
I know there's a lot more checks and hoops to jump through.

440
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,630
But hopefully we can get the PC one out

441
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,010
either at the end of the year or sometime early next year.

442
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,630
We've also got the option on the PC to release it

443
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,950
without the extra stuff and then add it later,

444
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,510
which we can't really do that on the Switch

445
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,810
because we're doing physical copies.

446
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,350
And technically we can do that on the Switch,

447
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,770
but I think people really didn't like the idea

448
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,830
of having a cartridge that hasn't got all the content on.

449
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,990
And because it's a niche product,

450
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,390
we're going to have to abide

451
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,990
by people's best wishes on that kind of thing.

452
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,450
And it totally makes sense.

453
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,470
I think that's one of the really cool things about physical,

454
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,210
is that it's your item, it's your game.

455
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,330
So if we only ship it with some of it,

456
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,970
it kind of defeats the purpose of it.

457
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,790
So yeah, Switch one will take a little bit longer

458
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,810
for that reason, but hopefully it's worth the wait.

459
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,650
And then once we've done the port,

460
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,590
the PC one and the Switch one

461
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,890
will basically be the same code base.

462
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:08,410
So we can also think about other consoles.

463
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,370
Yeah, but we don't have any other specific plans.

464
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:20,190
I've got a good friend who is very good

465
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,750
at coding for the Dreamcast.

466
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,390
Oh, that's cool.

467
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,250
Yeah, so I'm tempted to see if we can twist his arm

468
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,590
to make us a Dreamcast port, or at least help us to do that.

469
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,990
But it's not on our immediate radar.

470
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,930
We've got too much to concentrate on at the moment.

471
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,270
Yeah, for sure.

472
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,290
I mean, you've got four different systems

473
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,850
that you're releasing for.

474
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,690
Luckily, the EverCode is actually just an emulator

475
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,390
of the Game Boy Advance version.

476
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,590
Oh, right, yes.

477
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,850
So it's not really a separate build.

478
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,670
I mean, it is, but it's also almost the same

479
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,170
as the Game Boy Advance one.

480
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,370
That's one really cool thing about making a Game Boy Advance game,

481
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:10,230
is they're compact, everything in one package,

482
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,290
and you can run it in lots of places.

483
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:18,990
There's lots of emulators that can run the game no problem.

484
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,370
Yeah, I say no problem, actually, at the moment.

485
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,210
One pretty big emulator doesn't like the game.

486
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,810
But we've fixed it several times, so we'll fix it again.

487
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:37,470
Have you looked into the FPGAs as well,

488
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,930
like the Mr. FPGAs and running things on the GBA cores there?

489
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,270
Is that something that you're also making sure that that works?

490
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,810
Or is that a later issue?

491
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,310
No, I've got the analog pocket,

492
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,950
and it's a very beautiful machine.

493
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,450
I actually find it quite nice to test on.

494
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:07,230
A lot of the time I can plug it in via USB and make a build,

495
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,010
and our game takes three minutes to compile

496
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,050
or six minutes to compile,

497
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,150
depending if you've cleaned up the project or not.

498
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:24,270
And I can just get it to build straight over the USB cable,

499
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,250
and then I can just play it immediately once it's finished.

500
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,510
It's super convenient to have a hardware that you can test on.

501
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,670
It's always worked flawlessly on the analog pocket.

502
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,750
I don't think we ever ran into any specific issues.

503
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,890
I think there was maybe one graphical effect

504
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,090
that lost one line of pixels on the analog pocket,

505
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,210
and that's the only difference that I noticed

506
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,070
on the entire thing between that and real hardware.

507
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,670
But that was fixed, too.

508
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:12,470
But yeah, there's another emulation called GPSP

509
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,750
because it started out as a PSP emulator,

510
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,110
and that one is super lightweight,

511
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,250
so it can run on lots of low-end hardware.

512
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:37,150
But to do that, I guess they've got some clever approximations

513
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,070
and stuff, which sometimes it doesn't agree

514
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,350
with some of our code, I guess.

515
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,810
But I've got it running perfectly fine on my PSP,

516
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,870
but at the moment, I think there's some routine

517
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,450
to do with the save.

518
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,290
I think it's the save select screen.

519
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,870
It just doesn't like it, so we'll have to fix that this week.

520
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,930
But yeah, we've fixed the GPSP build

521
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,730
because it's important that emulators

522
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,250
can play the game well,

523
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,050
but we've fixed it several times during development,

524
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,050
so we'll just make sure we fix it before we send

525
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,450
our final build out on Monday.

526
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,010
Yeah, looking at the homebrew community,

527
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,230
and especially the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance community,

528
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,450
there are a lot of different emulators

529
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,550
with various compatibility.

530
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,290
So do you try to test them yourself,

531
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,450
or do you have a group of people

532
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,570
that are testing for you and helping you out?

533
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,490
Yeah, so we try to keep abreast

534
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:53,470
of all the various emulators that we can.

535
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,650
That's why I've got a PSP and an analog pocket

536
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,590
and various bits.

537
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,750
The Nano, the tiny little GBA emulator.

538
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,790
So I've been testing in various places,

539
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,910
but we've also got a very incredible group

540
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,970
of beta testers who have been testing it

541
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:23,130
on all sorts of things that I didn't even know

542
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,690
you could test it on.

543
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,430
And yeah, they found a lot of great things.

544
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,510
And unbelievable amount of issues

545
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,290
and strange edge cases.

546
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,390
But yeah, it's super, super useful

547
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,430
to have a bigger group of people testing it

548
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,310
because they can just find stuff

549
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,730
you wouldn't even think to look for.

550
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:48,870
Yeah.

551
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,470
So looking at Good Boy Galaxy,

552
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,090
you have a release date now for December,

553
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,750
and then you've got the PC ports

554
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,130
and Switch ports and everything as well.

555
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,330
What are your plans for going forward

556
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,130
after the release?

557
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,030
Do you have any plans to do a sequel

558
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,630
or is there something that you couldn't keep in the game

559
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,490
that you would like to do something with?

560
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,470
Yeah.

561
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,070
Well, to be honest,

562
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,430
we managed to keep almost all of our ideas in the game.

563
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,170
That's awesome.

564
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,490
We had some just random ideas

565
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,770
in the kitchen when we were working together

566
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,070
of like, oh, what if he opens a burger shop

567
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,430
to generate funds or something?

568
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,350
And yeah, all this stuff,

569
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,150
all the stuff that you'd think would get chopped away,

570
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,990
we managed to get it all in.

571
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:02,050
So on that sense, besides one planet that we did cut out,

572
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,910
we got really everything we wanted in the game.

573
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,870
But that's not to say that I wouldn't want to do it again

574
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,590
and make a whole new galaxy to explore.

575
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,930
I'd love to do that.

576
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,890
But at the moment, I'm just really dying

577
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,310
to work on something new.

578
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,970
So in between, we'll definitely work on a new project.

579
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,650
We've got a few of my old projects

580
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,290
that before I learned the skill of finishing anything.

581
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,170
So I've got a few of those I'd like to resurrect

582
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,790
in the meantime that should be faster to make

583
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,010
because A, we've got all the tech that we made for Good Boy

584
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,090
and B, we've got a head start on some of the assets

585
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,710
because I made this stuff years ago.

586
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,210
And yeah, so we can make something faster than

587
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,170
in two years' time this time.

588
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,090
And then while working on that, we can start coming up

589
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,210
with the bigger ideas or developing the bigger ideas

590
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,930
that we have to work on other projects.

591
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,010
And then maybe we'll come back around to Good Boy Galaxy

592
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,390
and make a sequel.

593
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,270
I think that sounds like a great idea.

594
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,230
Work on something else in between.

595
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,150
See how that goes as well.

596
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:25,410
Yeah.

597
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,990
A little palate cleanser.

598
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,310
Yeah, exactly.

599
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:35,510
I think back when we were doing 40-odd prototypes in a year

600
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,990
and then doing one game in two years,

601
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,690
I think there's a happy medium where we can have a few projects

602
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,150
on the go, but they're smaller.

603
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,590
And we've got some amount of work that's already

604
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,430
been undertaken.

605
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,650
So it's not quite the arduous task of Good Boy Galaxy.

606
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,570
Yeah, so I think that's what we're thinking at the moment.

607
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:07,090
You mentioned actually finishing projects.

608
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:13,310
It's very common to not finish projects.

609
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm an expert at not finishing projects myself.

610
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:25,250
So being locked in a physical medium where you have a release

611
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,210
and you want to release and you have to do that well

612
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,030
in advance, do you feel that that helped you finishing

613
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,690
the game?

614
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,090
Or did it make it harder?

615
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,090
Yeah, I mean, to some degree, it's like, well,

616
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,830
the deadline is now you have to deliver.

617
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,210
There's a deliverable.

618
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,090
You have to.

619
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,670
You can't not do that.

620
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,330
You can't be in breach of contract.

621
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,550
And although technically the Kickstarter is you're

622
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:02,690
not obligated, you're not guaranteed the reward,

623
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,430
you don't want to upset such a large amount of people.

624
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:08,590
Yeah, definitely.

625
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,190
Yeah, exactly.

626
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:16,510
So there's definitely obligations that need to be met,

627
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,900
which can feel like a burden, but also definitely

628
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,770
is a motivator.

629
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:36,740
But yeah, I think it's just, yeah,

630
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,720
like I said, it's not really a skill in itself.

631
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:48,180
It's just a mindset to not spend all your time coming

632
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,200
up with changing mind, making differing decisions

633
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,680
and just always keep some momentum going.

634
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,540
And then I think even the relatively big projects

635
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,960
are achievable, whether it's timely or not.

636
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,200
We underestimated the amount of time it would take

637
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
by 100%.

638
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,600
It took us twice as long as we thought.

639
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,540
And somehow amongst our peers, that's not even bad.

640
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,800
That's okay.

641
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,840
That's actually pretty good.

642
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,920
So yeah, just mindfuck should always be just keep

643
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,840
some momentum, and then it'll get you there.

644
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,800
I think a lot of developers say you should make small games,

645
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,400
lots of small games, which is kind of what we did

646
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,960
when we were working on prototypes,

647
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,380
so many prototypes to kind of exercise that muscle

648
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,020
of momentum.

649
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,260
But I think what a lot of developers don't really

650
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,780
talk about is it's kind of boring to work on small,

651
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,580
uninteresting projects when there's the great,

652
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,120
big magnum opus that everyone wants to work on.

653
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,220
So I think really loving what you're doing is also

654
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,540
a big motivator.

655
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,880
So yeah, it's not as easy as it sounds when people say

656
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,900
just work on 1,000 small projects.

657
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,340
It's not the only part of the equation.

658
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,260
Yeah, you definitely need to have the passion for it,

659
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,400
because otherwise it's not going to get done.

660
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:52,660
So looking at you, the studio, the game,

661
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,960
as part of the indie gaming community,

662
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,340
what are you excited about for the future of indie gaming?

663
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,360
We see here a big revival, I think,

664
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,660
of retro style and also retro games.

665
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,400
But retro style has been in vogue for a good number

666
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,220
of years now.

667
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,280
And I love it.

668
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,700
I'm a big, big fan of the retro style games.

669
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,660
Do you think we'll see more of that,

670
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,120
or will we move into a different type of genre?

671
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,680
Yeah, I mean, I'm not really...

672
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,040
I'm not sure that I'm the right person to really say.

673
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,060
I'm not like...

674
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,500
I'm not really abreast of all the trends on the consumer side.

675
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:54,020
What I really enjoy is just watching what people are making

676
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,480
and just taking it at face value and just enjoying it

677
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,720
for what it is.

678
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,680
So it's hard for me to forecast what the industry

679
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,540
or the community is going to be doing next.

680
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:14,040
But I think as long as people are making interesting stuff

681
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,720
that they personally find interesting,

682
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,120
I think that's always going to be where the gems come from.

683
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:30,180
And I think if any particular style,

684
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,080
like PlayStation 1 or games or something,

685
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,560
which you sometimes...

686
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,500
they seem to appear in small groups,

687
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,360
I don't think...

688
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,880
Although obviously people are inspired by each other's projects,

689
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,900
I don't think anyone's thinking,

690
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,380
I want to make a PlayStation 1 horror game just because I've seen...

691
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,080
Just because they've proved that there's a market there.

692
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,700
I think to make anything in this kind of hobby space,

693
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,320
you have to really deep down want to make it.

694
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,520
So I think...

695
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:12,980
I don't know how applicable it is to kind of chase trends like it.

696
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,500
Yeah, I just think they're so personal,

697
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,080
which is what I love about the indie game space.

698
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,760
Yeah, that's my opinion on it.

699
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,740
I don't know if that's in spirit of the question.

700
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,160
No, I think that's good.

701
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,440
I think we see a lot of passion projects.

702
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,340
And you can definitely tell when you're playing a game,

703
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,460
you can tell that the person who made this game

704
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,600
is proud of the game and had fun creating the game.

705
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,860
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:55,040
I think there's a lot to be unexcited about at the moment in indie gaming,

707
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,780
like with Twitter deteriorating and Unity imploding.

708
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,620
But in spirit of the question,

709
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,880
in its kind of optimistic view,

710
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,940
I think it maybe means there's a bit of a rebirth on the horizon,

711
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:22,460
like there'll be a new place for community and marketing,

712
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,300
and there'll be a new home for the Unity exiles.

713
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,700
I really love Blender,

714
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,720
so I'm really hoping that Godot becomes like the blender

715
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,620
of game development software.

716
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:45,000
I think, although it's not that much fun for a lot of people at the moment,

717
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,940
maybe there's a bright future.

718
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:54,420
And then, yeah, I mean, in terms of, yeah, like I say,

719
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,580
what I'm really excited about is just people's personal projects.

720
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:06,520
Like I love just scrolling through Twitter or Blue Sky or X, whatever,

721
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,020
and just watching what people are making,

722
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,140
and there's some really incredible stuff.

723
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,980
There's someone called Kosefi, I think, Chun-Fai.

724
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:24,220
They've been making a dungeon-faller game where you also play as a dog.

725
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,480
So that's, yeah, that's something that I like.

726
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,580
And it's just so, I think they're mainly a freelance artist,

727
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,460
but they're just in their spare time, been doing this for years.

728
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,340
It's so beautiful.

729
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,600
Like it's just every note is just absolutely perfect.

730
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,280
And every time that comes up on my Twitter feed,

731
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,840
I'm just like, it makes my day feel a little bit better.

732
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,020
And there's so many projects like that.

733
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,820
And I think, yeah, that's what I'm really excited about.

734
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,060
That's really cool.

735
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,300
Rick, this has been fantastic.

736
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,460
Thank you so much for talking to me today

737
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,280
and showcasing Good Boy Galaxy, diving into the game,

738
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,060
diving into you as a person.

739
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,980
This has been really, really fun.

740
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:13,000
Where can we find more information about Good Boy Galaxy,

741
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,060
about you, your projects?

742
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:23,480
So the best way to find the information is just go to our website,

743
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,560
which is goodboygalaxy.com.

744
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,440
And on that page, there's a link to our personal Twitters.

745
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,460
And yeah, that's where all the info is.

746
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,220
Fantastic.

747
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,400
Thank you so much, Rick.

748
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,360
Again, this has been fantastic.

749
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,200
And thank you, everyone who has listened in or watched us.

750
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,020
Have a fantastic week and see you all next time.

751
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,000
Bye.

752
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,760
Thank you very much.

753
00:51:51,760 --> 00:52:05,560
