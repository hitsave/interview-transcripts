00:43.810 --> 00:47.850
Hello everyone and welcome to yet another Hit Save podcast.

00:48.350 --> 00:54.570
I'm here with Rick Nickel of Good Boy Galaxy and you just saw the Good Boy Galaxy trailer

00:54.570 --> 00:57.590
that just came out like two weeks ago here.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.090
The latest one.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.910
It's really, really fun.

01:03.010 --> 01:04.610
Really fun game, first of all.

01:04.850 --> 01:06.230
Super cool trailer.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.410
And I love the music.

01:08.650 --> 01:09.410
So hi Rick.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.450
Hi Rick.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.290
Do you want to introduce yourself?

01:13.410 --> 01:13.890
Yeah.

01:13.970 --> 01:16.390
Hi, I'm Rick from Good Boy Galaxy.

01:17.810 --> 01:20.590
And yeah, I'm more on the creative side.

01:21.270 --> 01:27.030
And with my friend Jeremy, we've been working on Good Boy Galaxy for the past couple of

01:27.030 --> 01:27.270
years.

01:28.190 --> 01:30.510
So tell me a bit about Good Boy Galaxy.

01:30.710 --> 01:31.630
What is it?

01:33.110 --> 01:36.950
So it's a exploration-based platform game.

01:37.190 --> 01:41.010
I'm a bit hesitant to call it a Metroidvania because I don't think it really checks all

01:41.010 --> 01:41.430
the boxes.

01:43.050 --> 01:46.170
But it's kind of in the same vein a little bit.

01:47.610 --> 01:51.190
And yeah, it's a platform adventure game for the Game Boy Advance.

01:52.450 --> 01:59.230
So a new game for the Game Boy Advance being made in this year of 2023.

01:59.230 --> 02:03.310
What made you think of this?

02:03.590 --> 02:07.490
What made you go into making a Game Boy game in 2023?

02:07.950 --> 02:09.630
Or even a few years earlier?

02:10.470 --> 02:10.790
Yeah.

02:11.650 --> 02:16.810
Well, we started it as a game jam project.

02:16.950 --> 02:21.010
So it was just a small weekend project.

02:21.010 --> 02:29.050
And I think it was for the Ludum Dare game jam.

02:29.790 --> 02:36.970
And we just wondered, could we do it in such a short time frame?

02:37.670 --> 02:45.510
And we just about, to the very last hour, which is game jam tradition, did manage to

02:45.510 --> 02:53.670
pull off a playable game that had a couple of levels and an end that actually run on

02:53.670 --> 02:54.850
the Game Boy Advance.

02:55.110 --> 02:58.090
And of course, that made us overconfident.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.270
So we thought, it's easy, we can do this.

03:02.010 --> 03:06.910
And yeah, there was not much prior thought behind it.

03:07.290 --> 03:10.170
But it just felt like a fun thing to do.

03:10.630 --> 03:12.670
And it was a fun thing to do.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.250
We really enjoyed doing it.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.110
And the Game Boy Advance is just super special to us.

03:17.370 --> 03:19.690
So it felt right.

03:20.290 --> 03:26.650
And also with the kind of gratuitous, it was the 20th anniversary of the Game Boy Advance

03:26.650 --> 03:27.290
just recently.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.290
So it kind of lined up with that as well.

03:29.390 --> 03:32.930
So everything just kind of seemed in alignment at the time.

03:34.350 --> 03:35.970
But there wasn't really a special reason.

03:36.070 --> 03:37.770
It was just kind of, we thought it was fun.

03:37.990 --> 03:38.830
We thought it was interesting.

03:38.830 --> 03:46.330
And we didn't run into any very difficult obstacles that made us give up.

03:46.570 --> 03:48.130
So that's the reason, really.

03:49.510 --> 03:50.090
Awesome.

03:50.410 --> 03:56.550
So I want to show the picture here is of a GBA running your game.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.390
And this is my favorite form factor of the GBA.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.850
I know a lot of people will maybe disagree.

04:03.030 --> 04:08.810
But I think this is just a fantastic, iconic, handheld console.

04:11.090 --> 04:17.110
The amount of effort that you put into the game, as I was playing the beta release that

04:17.110 --> 04:20.090
you sent over to us, thank you so much for providing that.

04:20.910 --> 04:25.570
I was just amazed by the animations, the artwork.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.130
It's so colorful.

04:28.890 --> 04:31.250
It's really, really fun to play.

04:31.570 --> 04:37.990
And as you said, exploratory, just exploring the different areas and going back and trying

04:37.990 --> 04:40.610
new, different things, dying a lot.

04:42.150 --> 04:43.790
It's just so much fun.

04:44.590 --> 04:50.250
So how did you get into this?

04:50.430 --> 04:53.610
What's your background in game development?

04:53.850 --> 04:57.570
And how did you get to where you are right now developing this?

04:58.230 --> 04:59.670
Because it's a very polished game.

05:00.770 --> 05:01.470
Thank you very much.

05:02.750 --> 05:09.690
So I guess earlier in my career, I was working in web development and a bit of print design.

05:11.050 --> 05:18.650
But I was always doing kind of small freelance things or hobby things, mainly pixel art for

05:19.370 --> 05:21.710
mobile games and stuff like that.

05:23.030 --> 05:25.830
So that was my background.

05:25.830 --> 05:35.090
And then a few years ago, six years ago, I moved to the Netherlands to work at a mobile

05:35.090 --> 05:36.950
game studio called Lucky Cat.

05:38.610 --> 05:40.490
And that's where I met Jeremy.

05:41.310 --> 05:46.250
So we had a few years, a couple of years working together there, too.

05:48.190 --> 06:00.710
And I think it's really when I developed my skill set a bit more because we were doing

06:00.710 --> 06:04.910
like 40 something prototypes a year.

06:05.270 --> 06:08.610
Like it's a crazy amount of projects.

06:09.310 --> 06:13.310
So it was just like nonstop learning.

06:13.970 --> 06:16.230
And yeah, that's how I got into it.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.270
And that's where I met Jeremy.

06:18.370 --> 06:21.570
He's also from England, but we both met in the Netherlands.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.330
Just a short jump over the puddle.

06:27.310 --> 06:28.650
Yeah, very short.

06:30.310 --> 06:32.250
They're surprisingly similar countries.

06:33.230 --> 06:40.130
But yeah, we did a couple of game jams in the weekends.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.610
And yeah, this was one of them.

06:44.010 --> 06:50.630
You said you did about 40 projects a year plus game jams during the weekend.

06:50.990 --> 06:51.070
Yeah.

06:51.670 --> 06:56.590
That sounds like a lot of innovation, a lot of trying new things.

06:57.270 --> 07:06.570
Yeah, it is kind of, it's like a, it's something that you practice and kind of get good at.

07:06.570 --> 07:14.730
But I'm hesitant to call it its own skill because actually the skill is just,

07:16.810 --> 07:24.030
it's kind of like just accepting the idea that comes to you and just doing it and not interrogating it too much.

07:25.830 --> 07:29.450
And then you discover things along the way.

07:29.450 --> 07:36.530
But yeah, that's definitely had a relatively big part in this project coming about.

07:37.210 --> 07:48.050
What were some of the other game jam projects that you tried out but didn't feel like it had legs to stand on its own, such as Good Boy Galaxy?

07:49.050 --> 07:58.750
The one other game jam that I did with Jeremy was, it was called Super Bike Strike.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.070
Super Bike Strike?

08:01.810 --> 08:05.710
Yeah, it was kind of like a side-scrolling shoot-em-up.

08:06.690 --> 08:15.110
But the interesting thing was you'd jump from your ship, which is actually a hover bike,

08:16.030 --> 08:21.790
and then you'd land on the other person's bike and like punch them off.

08:23.390 --> 08:27.810
And then their bike would like fall down and smash into other bikes.

08:27.910 --> 08:29.370
So you could have quite a chain reaction.

08:30.430 --> 08:38.370
And there was like a bit of a double jump to save you from just immediately falling down.

08:39.590 --> 08:46.190
It's that little bit of gameplay, the bit where you jump and attack,

08:47.530 --> 08:52.650
is super satisfying when you actually land on the bike, that you intend to.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.750
But we did run into some trouble.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.690
It's actually a little bit more difficult than you want it to be.

08:59.690 --> 09:08.870
And one of the caveats to the difficulty is the game is actually more difficult

09:08.870 --> 09:13.290
the fewer enemies are around, which is actually inverse what you expect.

09:14.670 --> 09:19.630
But it also ramps up the challenge in other ways that way, because you've got more people shooting at you.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.930
So it's very difficult to get the balance right.

09:26.370 --> 09:31.370
And to get the game feel to good, it had to be quite fast and quite zoomed in.

09:31.450 --> 09:34.710
But that also made it more difficult to land where you want.

09:35.650 --> 09:42.110
And I think the idea's got legs, but I think it'd have to be done maybe in 3D or something

09:42.110 --> 09:46.250
to make it a bit more user-friendly, I guess.

09:46.470 --> 09:50.970
But yeah, that's the previous game jam that we did before Good Boy.

09:50.970 --> 09:54.650
That sounds really cool too. I would love to try that out.

09:55.510 --> 09:56.670
I'll send you a link afterwards.

09:57.350 --> 09:57.890
Fantastic.

09:59.390 --> 10:05.350
So Good Boy Galaxy was thought up as a game jam project during a weekend.

10:06.370 --> 10:09.870
How did you go about after the game jam?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.490
What was your thought process like?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.930
Like, okay, maybe we should do something here.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.470
How did you go about actually doing something?

10:18.470 --> 10:22.590
You ran a Kickstarter. I definitely want to dive into that as well.

10:24.250 --> 10:29.390
Yeah, so we didn't really think about the Kickstarter for quite a long time.

10:29.570 --> 10:35.290
We were just working on it a weekend a month or something, just here and there.

10:37.230 --> 10:42.870
And then I think it's when COVID hit, everyone was working from home

10:42.870 --> 10:45.350
and suddenly had their commute time.

10:45.350 --> 10:52.690
And there was less to do.

10:52.990 --> 10:55.850
So we got more done.

10:56.310 --> 11:02.150
And that's when we were getting the demo that ended up launching the Kickstarter.

11:05.370 --> 11:11.310
So yeah, we got the demo ready.

11:11.310 --> 11:18.530
And then we just decided to make it a full...

11:18.530 --> 11:22.950
At that point, it was quite obvious that it was worth pursuing.

11:23.430 --> 11:28.530
But when it was just the game jam version, it was just a little side hobby.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.150
It wasn't that interesting.

11:30.410 --> 11:33.730
But at the point when the demo was taking shape

11:33.730 --> 11:36.670
is when we decided to take it to Kickstarter.

11:37.950 --> 11:42.890
So what was your experience with Kickstarter?

11:51.550 --> 11:58.050
We'd partnered with First Press to publish the physical copies

11:59.890 --> 12:03.350
before we did the Kickstarter.

12:03.350 --> 12:07.170
And they'd done a few other Kickstarters before.

12:07.410 --> 12:10.250
So we kind of knew a little bit what to expect.

12:13.430 --> 12:20.790
So yeah, basically, the deal was we had a limited amount that we could sell.

12:21.570 --> 12:25.790
And then basically, we didn't really have to pay for it.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.130
It was kind of like an advance.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.290
So that's why it's limited.

12:29.510 --> 12:33.410
So that it's safe for all parties.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.890
But of course, we blew through the whole thing in the first day,

12:38.950 --> 12:40.470
which nobody really expected.

12:41.870 --> 12:44.630
And then people were angry about it.

12:44.850 --> 12:49.590
And we were kind of unprepared for it.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.750
So it's a bit stressful, to be honest.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.750
And of course, we're both still working.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.710
We kind of wanted, or we kind of expected,

12:57.090 --> 13:01.670
it to be a bit of a continuation of a side Hollywood project.

13:02.150 --> 13:06.410
But when you have a Kickstarter that successful,

13:08.750 --> 13:13.430
you're kind of responsible to fulfil your biggest promises.

13:14.350 --> 13:19.890
So it was kind of a mix, mixed emotions.

13:20.190 --> 13:23.390
I was also finding it difficult to sleep with all that going on.

13:23.390 --> 13:30.670
So it's like heightening the emotions of the excitement and the stress.

13:31.370 --> 13:37.650
But I mean, it was definitely a very overall positive experience.

13:37.970 --> 13:44.290
And it was definitely super grateful for everyone that's backed the project

13:44.290 --> 13:50.790
and given us this opportunity to make the game exactly as we really want to.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.990
And not just cutting corners and doing it here and there.

13:55.370 --> 14:00.730
So yeah, hopefully they're happy with their decision

14:00.730 --> 14:02.690
when they finally get to play the game.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.530
Yeah, what I've seen so far from the game,

14:06.590 --> 14:10.610
I definitely think that people are going to be very, very happy with the end result.

14:10.870 --> 14:17.110
Again, I am amazed by the animation, the colour.

14:17.110 --> 14:21.030
It pops, it really, really pops.

14:21.450 --> 14:24.790
The music is really solid.

14:25.950 --> 14:29.150
So what is your role within the game?

14:29.170 --> 14:31.330
And what's Jeremy's role in the game?

14:32.410 --> 14:37.990
Yeah, so I guess the trouble is we both do a bit of everything.

14:38.390 --> 14:44.770
But from my side, it's mainly creative stuff, all the art and animation.

14:46.110 --> 14:50.330
And a lot of the game design, I guess, comes from my side.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.930
And then from Jeremy's side, he's like the technical guy.

14:55.110 --> 15:04.270
He's set up the project, all the programming, his remit.

15:05.850 --> 15:08.970
And making sure it compiles, fixing bugs,

15:09.790 --> 15:14.290
tracking down the most esoteric thing that you can possibly imagine

15:14.290 --> 15:15.750
in the Game Boy Advance's hardware.

15:17.370 --> 15:20.230
But yeah, there's definitely some overlap.

15:20.450 --> 15:24.710
I've also done a lot of coding myself,

15:24.890 --> 15:28.530
like a lot of the fancy effects in the backgrounds

15:28.530 --> 15:30.610
and all the quests and stuff.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.470
A lot of that's me. Sometimes it has to be fixed.

15:35.510 --> 15:38.630
And then music, we've both kind of done.

15:38.630 --> 15:45.190
Also Vincent Perger, aka Tui, did a lot of the music in the game.

15:47.850 --> 15:52.330
But yeah, me and Jeremy both like doing music too.

15:52.430 --> 15:54.390
So we've both had a hand in that.

15:55.110 --> 15:57.510
And then level design, we've also both done.

15:57.830 --> 16:02.730
We have slightly different philosophies when it comes to level design.

16:02.730 --> 16:12.750
So Jeremy makes the most clever and cruel Mario Maker levels

16:12.750 --> 16:15.430
that you've ever played and that are very difficult,

16:15.710 --> 16:18.210
but very clever mechanically.

16:18.890 --> 16:29.410
And from my design background and from all the time working on mobile games,

16:29.410 --> 16:34.530
I've very much got the mindset of simplification,

16:35.190 --> 16:37.070
making everything move.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.250
So it's interesting.

16:41.530 --> 16:43.830
We've worked collaboratively on the levels

16:43.830 --> 16:47.110
and we're both making passives over each other's work

16:47.530 --> 16:50.730
until eventually we've got something that's...

16:51.470 --> 16:54.050
We like to think of it as a bit of cake and eating it too,

16:54.150 --> 16:55.970
because we've got the clever ideas,

16:55.970 --> 16:59.950
but hopefully there's less frustration.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.790
I don't want to sound the corners off completely,

17:03.990 --> 17:09.510
but we've tried to make it so that there's no showstoppers

17:09.510 --> 17:11.570
if you get completely stuck.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.650
But yeah, that's where we're at.

17:16.290 --> 17:19.210
You mentioned that there are some quirks

17:19.210 --> 17:22.110
when it comes to programming for the GBA.

17:22.110 --> 17:27.610
What are some challenges that you have met and overcome,

17:27.750 --> 17:28.850
or at least tried to overcome?

17:32.430 --> 17:36.890
It's a relatively advanced...

17:37.430 --> 17:38.610
You'll forgive the pun.

17:42.130 --> 17:48.570
It's got the feeling like it's a SNES or a Mega Drive or a Genesis,

17:48.570 --> 17:52.390
but it's actually a lot more powerful.

17:52.710 --> 17:56.190
So it's a lot freer than you'd imagine,

17:56.950 --> 17:58.590
or you might imagine it would be,

17:58.750 --> 18:02.270
but there's still some tight restrictions.

18:04.970 --> 18:07.270
There's only a finite amount of layers.

18:07.430 --> 18:10.230
There's only four layers, I think.

18:10.230 --> 18:20.330
And we work in four bits per pixel, I think,

18:20.590 --> 18:25.690
which is 15 colours per spline or per tile.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.630
Yeah, there's a lot of clever tricks

18:32.630 --> 18:35.270
to try and get the absolute most out of it.

18:35.450 --> 18:36.550
Like with the layers,

18:36.550 --> 18:40.180
sometimes we split them into sections

18:41.350 --> 18:44.790
so that we can scroll one layer at different speeds,

18:44.830 --> 18:46.390
depending on where it is,

18:46.610 --> 18:48.870
to get the feeling of more depth

18:48.870 --> 18:53.870
and constantly running a lot of...

18:54.710 --> 18:59.510
So from the art side, I really want to make the levels feel unique

18:59.510 --> 19:03.250
and have lots of areas within them

19:03.250 --> 19:08.030
that feel not quite set piece,

19:08.170 --> 19:10.710
but at least so you know where you are,

19:10.750 --> 19:15.830
because you can go through the level in several different ways.

19:15.890 --> 19:18.050
It's important to have landmarks,

19:19.090 --> 19:23.690
but that's expensive when you can only have so many tiles in memory.

19:25.010 --> 19:28.550
So we went through incredible lengths

19:28.550 --> 19:32.670
of automatically figuring out

19:32.670 --> 19:36.710
which tiles are similar enough to be collapsed into one tile.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.870
We can keep them...

19:40.570 --> 19:46.970
We can flip and mirrored versions of the tiles

19:46.970 --> 19:48.510
don't count as an extra tile.

19:48.670 --> 19:51.890
So we have lots of clever use of that.

19:53.110 --> 19:53.650
That's smart.

19:54.330 --> 19:57.970
Yeah, there's so many really...

19:59.890 --> 20:03.790
quite arduous tasks that end up just shaving enough off

20:03.790 --> 20:06.410
that you can do what you actually wanted to do in the first place,

20:06.550 --> 20:12.010
which is super important on the low-end consoles.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.330
But obviously when we do the switch port,

20:14.430 --> 20:15.510
which we're just starting now,

20:16.610 --> 20:20.950
it's probably all this stuff is no longer necessary.

20:20.950 --> 20:26.170
But it was fun, little puzzles to figure out.

20:26.590 --> 20:27.910
So I enjoyed it anyway.

20:29.030 --> 20:29.550
That's awesome.

20:30.490 --> 20:35.390
So we've gone quite deep into the technical weeds already.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.670
So I want to bring us back up a bit

20:38.270 --> 20:41.190
and talk about the game itself

20:41.190 --> 20:45.650
and the story in the game, the characters.

20:46.050 --> 20:50.070
So tell us a bit about who you are as a player

20:50.070 --> 20:53.190
and what the mission is, the story is.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.770
Okay. So the background of the game

20:56.770 --> 21:03.170
or the overarching story is that you're this dog

21:03.170 --> 21:04.390
named Maxwell.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.530
He's not a dog from Earth.

21:07.610 --> 21:10.230
He's a dog from the dog galaxy, obviously.

21:11.850 --> 21:18.570
And his system or his planet is dying

21:18.570 --> 21:23.050
or collapsing or in trouble.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.670
So being the good boy that he is,

21:27.750 --> 21:34.750
he takes it on himself to use his hyperdrive

21:34.750 --> 21:37.410
to blast to a whole new system

21:37.410 --> 21:41.450
with no idea if he's going to find anything

21:41.450 --> 21:45.150
or find advanced civilization that could help him.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.270
It's a big risk, basically.

21:49.910 --> 21:53.330
So he goes ahead and does that.

21:53.510 --> 21:56.170
And then he has to use every single jump

21:56.170 --> 21:58.690
at his availability.

21:59.050 --> 22:03.070
So now he's completely stranded in this new galaxy.

22:03.230 --> 22:09.630
But he has found life, civilization and such.

22:10.050 --> 22:13.530
But yeah, so it's his job now to figure out a way home

22:13.530 --> 22:17.550
and also figure out if there's someone

22:17.550 --> 22:20.210
that can actually help him in his original mission.

22:21.810 --> 22:25.470
Yeah, the reason we did it like this is we wanted

22:28.630 --> 22:34.750
to really emphasize exploration and discovery,

22:34.970 --> 22:35.790
I guess is the right word.

22:36.850 --> 22:41.510
So having Maxwell also be discovering this at the same time

22:41.510 --> 22:44.890
as the player made the most sense to us.

22:46.870 --> 22:53.270
One of our mantras when deciding and designing the worlds

22:53.270 --> 22:55.770
and stuff was the word surprise.

22:56.990 --> 23:03.150
So we really wanted there to be unexpected things

23:03.150 --> 23:05.670
to find when you're exploring stuff.

23:06.250 --> 23:09.810
And the best way we felt to go about that was

23:09.810 --> 23:14.670
to make everything unexpected in the sense that it's all alien

23:14.670 --> 23:18.290
to you, the player, and also to the character

23:18.290 --> 23:19.130
that you're playing as.

23:21.890 --> 23:27.090
The exploration, I mentioned earlier here that I died a lot.

23:27.830 --> 23:30.510
But it doesn't feel punishing.

23:31.070 --> 23:35.690
It's more like, yes, I know why I perished here.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.610
Because I was doing something that I shouldn't.

23:40.330 --> 23:43.690
So then I try again, and I die, and I try again, and I die.

23:43.790 --> 23:48.230
And then eventually I figure out, oh, no, wait, this is the way I'm going about this.

23:49.710 --> 23:55.650
I really like the quick return

23:56.850 --> 23:59.350
to where you were so you can try it again.

24:01.730 --> 24:05.490
It's a very forgiving gameplay, I would say,

24:05.590 --> 24:07.990
even though it's hard at times.

24:08.190 --> 24:09.130
It's very forgiving.

24:09.730 --> 24:11.250
And it's super, super fun.

24:13.870 --> 24:19.490
I love the interactions

24:19.490 --> 24:22.830
between the good boy here, Maxwell,

24:23.530 --> 24:25.650
and the characters that he meets.

24:26.010 --> 24:27.210
Because it's super funny.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.170
It's really well written.

24:31.290 --> 24:35.670
I think it's on the second world.

24:37.050 --> 24:41.330
I don't want to spoil the surprise, but you get locked in

24:41.330 --> 24:43.570
a little for a bit.

24:44.010 --> 24:45.830
And I was not prepared for that at all.

24:45.930 --> 24:48.770
I was like, oh, wait, this is very different.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.970
And you have to fight your way out.

24:52.670 --> 24:54.330
It's really, really fun.

24:54.330 --> 25:00.330
And I love that, as you said, the environment is alien.

25:00.490 --> 25:03.750
So you're exploring as well as Maxwell

25:03.750 --> 25:07.710
and just finding things out and learning about the environment.

25:08.850 --> 25:10.210
It's super, super fun.

25:12.330 --> 25:12.910
Thank you very much.

25:13.610 --> 25:18.910
So you said you go off the theme of surprise.

25:20.330 --> 25:23.050
So how do you plan for surprises?

25:26.530 --> 25:28.070
It's a good question.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.510
I think surprise is maybe too strong a word.

25:30.770 --> 25:32.890
But it's what we told ourselves.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.350
So we ask with it.

25:35.530 --> 25:35.930
I like it.

25:38.550 --> 25:42.550
I think, yeah, how we dealt with this

25:42.550 --> 25:45.550
was mainly me and my friend Andreas.

25:47.470 --> 25:50.650
And Andreas is a guy that I met in London

25:51.190 --> 25:52.310
when I lived there.

25:52.310 --> 25:57.070
And he's this super chill dude.

25:57.270 --> 25:59.850
And he's super creative.

26:00.630 --> 26:04.470
Kind of like Jake the dog from Adventure Time.

26:05.210 --> 26:08.110
So basically we'd have these long chats.

26:08.370 --> 26:12.990
And Andreas was working on concept art with me.

26:13.150 --> 26:16.930
So we were kind of coming up with a lot of these ideas together.

26:17.730 --> 26:21.610
I think if I was coming up with everything on my own,

26:21.610 --> 26:22.390
I don't know.

26:23.570 --> 26:25.890
I couldn't really surprise myself.

26:26.230 --> 26:28.690
Or I couldn't really have that sense of wonder.

26:28.890 --> 26:29.870
So when we were collaborating,

26:30.050 --> 26:33.250
it was super important because I knew what was

26:33.840 --> 26:38.190
what would grab my sense of wonder

26:38.190 --> 26:39.030
or my attention.

26:39.690 --> 26:44.930
And we'd figure out a way to combine our ideas

26:44.930 --> 26:46.290
and workshop things.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.210
So yeah, we basically just had

26:50.950 --> 26:53.910
just conversations where we were talking about

26:54.610 --> 26:57.330
broad ideas and then just

26:58.390 --> 27:00.350
going away, sketching things out,

27:01.850 --> 27:04.990
coming up with random...

27:04.990 --> 27:06.450
Sometimes it would be a visual design

27:06.450 --> 27:09.210
and then we'd come up with the lore behind it.

27:09.610 --> 27:12.870
And sometimes it'd be we had a vague idea

27:12.870 --> 27:15.410
of what kind of a character

27:15.410 --> 27:18.930
and then one of us would go and draw it

27:18.930 --> 27:21.050
and then we'd develop it a bit more.

27:21.610 --> 27:24.810
But yeah, I think there was a bit of back and forth

27:24.810 --> 27:27.010
between us that really...

27:27.010 --> 27:30.350
That's basically how we planned for Surprise,

27:30.470 --> 27:31.850
was by surprising each other.

27:32.790 --> 27:34.430
I think that's a really good method.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.130
It seems to have worked really well.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.970
I definitely was surprised

27:41.990 --> 27:44.250
by the piece that I'm playing,

27:44.510 --> 27:45.870
the parts that I've been playing.

27:46.370 --> 27:48.890
And yeah, it's just, again, super, super fun.

27:49.870 --> 27:53.750
So how did you get into game development?

27:53.970 --> 27:57.290
What was it that drove you to start

27:57.950 --> 28:01.110
with game development all these years ago?

28:03.850 --> 28:07.710
Yes, I guess I was always kind of

28:08.870 --> 28:10.230
interested in it.

28:12.290 --> 28:17.070
I grew up with like an 8-bit Atari.

28:19.970 --> 28:21.770
And yeah, I just...

28:21.770 --> 28:25.570
I was always sketching ideas for games

28:25.570 --> 28:28.830
and trying my best to program in BASIC.

28:29.130 --> 28:31.510
And yeah, it's been something

28:31.510 --> 28:36.010
that I've been doing for my whole life, basically.

28:36.010 --> 28:38.910
So it's really hard to pinpoint a specific moment.

28:39.030 --> 28:43.730
But I think a lot of those older games,

28:43.930 --> 28:44.990
they're kind of...

28:48.810 --> 28:54.830
They kind of have an alien, otherworldly feel to them

28:54.830 --> 28:56.570
a little bit by accident,

28:56.690 --> 28:59.350
because they often didn't...

28:59.350 --> 29:02.510
It wasn't normal yet to have an artist involved in the game.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.810
So it was abstract to the point of absurdity.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.190
In some cases.

29:07.750 --> 29:12.690
And yeah, it felt something separate to real life.

29:12.750 --> 29:13.890
Whereas games now, obviously,

29:14.250 --> 29:15.410
some of them are very realistic

29:15.410 --> 29:21.810
and feel almost like a movie or a dream or something.

29:22.330 --> 29:25.630
Whereas some of those older games

29:25.630 --> 29:31.210
seemed to be almost like this whole separate thing to reality.

29:31.210 --> 29:33.550
And I think that really...

29:34.910 --> 29:37.590
It really affected my imagination, I guess,

29:37.670 --> 29:42.230
because it just really made you want to fill in the details

29:42.230 --> 29:45.050
and come up with your own other worlds.

29:46.490 --> 29:52.230
So yeah, for me, it's almost like it's been there since day one.

29:52.390 --> 29:56.050
I've just finally gone out on my own

29:56.050 --> 29:59.910
and made something that's more my own

29:59.910 --> 30:03.570
rather than working for hire on other people's projects.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.510
And for Jeremy, I think it's similar.

30:07.830 --> 30:10.370
He grew up with consoles

30:10.370 --> 30:15.110
rather than quite the old-man computers that I had.

30:17.370 --> 30:20.350
And yeah, he's been, like I said,

30:20.390 --> 30:24.630
working on Mario Maker levels and this kind of thing.

30:24.830 --> 30:28.230
So for him, I think it's...

30:28.230 --> 30:31.450
Yeah, I think it's a similar thing.

30:31.570 --> 30:33.690
It's something that we've kind of grown up with,

30:34.090 --> 30:36.590
but just from slightly different perspectives.

30:38.030 --> 30:38.410
Cool.

30:39.770 --> 30:43.550
So, Good Boy Galaxy is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.

30:43.950 --> 30:45.970
You also mentioned Nintendo Switch port.

30:46.630 --> 30:49.010
What else will it be on?

30:50.270 --> 30:56.050
There's an Evercade version that's also announced, I think.

30:58.170 --> 31:03.390
I'm not 100% sure when that one's shipping.

31:04.010 --> 31:05.310
I think it might be December.

31:06.930 --> 31:10.170
So similar time to the Game Boy Advance version.

31:10.890 --> 31:14.550
And then we've got the Switch version and the PC version,

31:14.610 --> 31:16.050
which we're doing now.

31:16.630 --> 31:19.130
We're trying to add a little extra to that.

31:19.190 --> 31:22.970
So we're trying to add some local co-op missions.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.270
So it's going to take a little bit longer,

31:27.410 --> 31:29.850
but hopefully not too much longer.

31:31.610 --> 31:34.150
The Switch one is a bit of a question mark.

31:34.610 --> 31:40.090
I know there's a lot more checks and hoops to jump through.

31:40.670 --> 31:42.630
But hopefully we can get the PC one out

31:42.630 --> 31:46.010
either at the end of the year or sometime early next year.

31:47.150 --> 31:50.630
We've also got the option on the PC to release it

31:50.630 --> 31:53.950
without the extra stuff and then add it later,

31:54.270 --> 31:56.510
which we can't really do that on the Switch

31:56.510 --> 31:58.810
because we're doing physical copies.

31:59.550 --> 32:03.350
And technically we can do that on the Switch,

32:03.610 --> 32:06.770
but I think people really didn't like the idea

32:06.770 --> 32:09.830
of having a cartridge that hasn't got all the content on.

32:11.950 --> 32:13.990
And because it's a niche product,

32:13.990 --> 32:17.390
we're going to have to abide

32:17.390 --> 32:21.990
by people's best wishes on that kind of thing.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.450
And it totally makes sense.

32:25.210 --> 32:31.470
I think that's one of the really cool things about physical,

32:31.750 --> 32:36.210
is that it's your item, it's your game.

32:37.070 --> 32:39.330
So if we only ship it with some of it,

32:39.550 --> 32:41.970
it kind of defeats the purpose of it.

32:41.970 --> 32:45.790
So yeah, Switch one will take a little bit longer

32:45.790 --> 32:49.810
for that reason, but hopefully it's worth the wait.

32:50.850 --> 32:56.650
And then once we've done the port,

32:57.970 --> 32:59.590
the PC one and the Switch one

32:59.590 --> 33:01.890
will basically be the same code base.

33:02.030 --> 33:08.410
So we can also think about other consoles.

33:09.910 --> 33:14.370
Yeah, but we don't have any other specific plans.

33:14.790 --> 33:20.190
I've got a good friend who is very good

33:20.190 --> 33:21.750
at coding for the Dreamcast.

33:22.350 --> 33:23.390
Oh, that's cool.

33:24.130 --> 33:28.250
Yeah, so I'm tempted to see if we can twist his arm

33:28.250 --> 33:31.590
to make us a Dreamcast port, or at least help us to do that.

33:32.130 --> 33:34.990
But it's not on our immediate radar.

33:35.170 --> 33:37.930
We've got too much to concentrate on at the moment.

33:37.930 --> 33:39.270
Yeah, for sure.

33:39.530 --> 33:42.290
I mean, you've got four different systems

33:42.290 --> 33:43.850
that you're releasing for.

33:44.390 --> 33:48.690
Luckily, the EverCode is actually just an emulator

33:48.690 --> 33:50.390
of the Game Boy Advance version.

33:50.390 --> 33:51.590
Oh, right, yes.

33:52.050 --> 33:54.850
So it's not really a separate build.

33:55.110 --> 33:58.670
I mean, it is, but it's also almost the same

33:58.670 --> 34:00.170
as the Game Boy Advance one.

34:01.910 --> 34:05.370
That's one really cool thing about making a Game Boy Advance game,

34:05.370 --> 34:10.230
is they're compact, everything in one package,

34:10.330 --> 34:12.290
and you can run it in lots of places.

34:12.430 --> 34:18.990
There's lots of emulators that can run the game no problem.

34:20.530 --> 34:22.370
Yeah, I say no problem, actually, at the moment.

34:24.050 --> 34:27.210
One pretty big emulator doesn't like the game.

34:27.310 --> 34:29.810
But we've fixed it several times, so we'll fix it again.

34:31.150 --> 34:37.470
Have you looked into the FPGAs as well,

34:37.650 --> 34:42.930
like the Mr. FPGAs and running things on the GBA cores there?

34:43.550 --> 34:47.270
Is that something that you're also making sure that that works?

34:47.530 --> 34:49.810
Or is that a later issue?

34:50.850 --> 34:54.310
No, I've got the analog pocket,

34:54.490 --> 34:56.950
and it's a very beautiful machine.

34:56.950 --> 35:01.450
I actually find it quite nice to test on.

35:01.710 --> 35:07.230
A lot of the time I can plug it in via USB and make a build,

35:07.590 --> 35:10.010
and our game takes three minutes to compile

35:10.010 --> 35:12.050
or six minutes to compile,

35:12.210 --> 35:16.150
depending if you've cleaned up the project or not.

35:16.650 --> 35:24.270
And I can just get it to build straight over the USB cable,

35:24.270 --> 35:27.250
and then I can just play it immediately once it's finished.

35:28.450 --> 35:33.510
It's super convenient to have a hardware that you can test on.

35:35.530 --> 35:40.670
It's always worked flawlessly on the analog pocket.

35:41.130 --> 35:45.750
I don't think we ever ran into any specific issues.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.890
I think there was maybe one graphical effect

35:47.890 --> 35:51.090
that lost one line of pixels on the analog pocket,

35:51.150 --> 35:53.210
and that's the only difference that I noticed

35:53.210 --> 35:58.070
on the entire thing between that and real hardware.

35:59.830 --> 36:01.670
But that was fixed, too.

36:02.830 --> 36:12.470
But yeah, there's another emulation called GPSP

36:12.470 --> 36:16.750
because it started out as a PSP emulator,

36:19.670 --> 36:23.110
and that one is super lightweight,

36:23.310 --> 36:27.250
so it can run on lots of low-end hardware.

36:29.530 --> 36:37.150
But to do that, I guess they've got some clever approximations

36:37.150 --> 36:40.070
and stuff, which sometimes it doesn't agree

36:40.070 --> 36:44.350
with some of our code, I guess.

36:44.930 --> 36:48.810
But I've got it running perfectly fine on my PSP,

36:48.970 --> 36:53.870
but at the moment, I think there's some routine

36:53.870 --> 36:56.450
to do with the save.

36:57.430 --> 37:00.290
I think it's the save select screen.

37:00.430 --> 37:03.870
It just doesn't like it, so we'll have to fix that this week.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.930
But yeah, we've fixed the GPSP build

37:07.930 --> 37:10.730
because it's important that emulators

37:10.730 --> 37:14.250
can play the game well,

37:14.510 --> 37:17.050
but we've fixed it several times during development,

37:17.250 --> 37:20.050
so we'll just make sure we fix it before we send

37:20.050 --> 37:21.450
our final build out on Monday.

37:22.570 --> 37:25.010
Yeah, looking at the homebrew community,

37:25.390 --> 37:29.230
and especially the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance community,

37:29.390 --> 37:31.450
there are a lot of different emulators

37:32.430 --> 37:34.550
with various compatibility.

37:35.550 --> 37:40.290
So do you try to test them yourself,

37:40.570 --> 37:43.450
or do you have a group of people

37:43.450 --> 37:45.570
that are testing for you and helping you out?

37:47.010 --> 37:49.490
Yeah, so we try to keep abreast

37:49.490 --> 37:53.470
of all the various emulators that we can.

37:53.590 --> 37:56.650
That's why I've got a PSP and an analog pocket

37:56.650 --> 37:59.590
and various bits.

38:01.210 --> 38:06.750
The Nano, the tiny little GBA emulator.

38:07.830 --> 38:11.790
So I've been testing in various places,

38:11.790 --> 38:14.910
but we've also got a very incredible group

38:14.910 --> 38:17.970
of beta testers who have been testing it

38:17.970 --> 38:23.130
on all sorts of things that I didn't even know

38:23.130 --> 38:24.690
you could test it on.

38:26.350 --> 38:29.430
And yeah, they found a lot of great things.

38:29.430 --> 38:32.510
And unbelievable amount of issues

38:32.990 --> 38:35.290
and strange edge cases.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.390
But yeah, it's super, super useful

38:39.390 --> 38:43.430
to have a bigger group of people testing it

38:43.430 --> 38:46.310
because they can just find stuff

38:46.310 --> 38:47.730
you wouldn't even think to look for.

38:48.850 --> 38:48.870
Yeah.

38:52.270 --> 38:54.470
So looking at Good Boy Galaxy,

38:54.910 --> 38:58.090
you have a release date now for December,

38:58.090 --> 39:01.750
and then you've got the PC ports

39:01.750 --> 39:04.130
and Switch ports and everything as well.

39:05.270 --> 39:10.330
What are your plans for going forward

39:10.330 --> 39:12.130
after the release?

39:12.750 --> 39:16.030
Do you have any plans to do a sequel

39:16.030 --> 39:20.630
or is there something that you couldn't keep in the game

39:20.630 --> 39:22.490
that you would like to do something with?

39:23.190 --> 39:23.470
Yeah.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.070
Well, to be honest,

39:27.070 --> 39:31.430
we managed to keep almost all of our ideas in the game.

39:31.750 --> 39:32.170
That's awesome.

39:33.110 --> 39:36.490
We had some just random ideas

39:37.150 --> 39:39.770
in the kitchen when we were working together

39:40.870 --> 39:44.070
of like, oh, what if he opens a burger shop

39:44.070 --> 39:47.430
to generate funds or something?

39:48.130 --> 39:50.350
And yeah, all this stuff,

39:50.350 --> 39:54.150
all the stuff that you'd think would get chopped away,

39:54.190 --> 39:55.990
we managed to get it all in.

39:56.530 --> 40:02.050
So on that sense, besides one planet that we did cut out,

40:02.150 --> 40:07.910
we got really everything we wanted in the game.

40:08.530 --> 40:11.870
But that's not to say that I wouldn't want to do it again

40:11.870 --> 40:14.590
and make a whole new galaxy to explore.

40:15.790 --> 40:16.930
I'd love to do that.

40:16.930 --> 40:20.890
But at the moment, I'm just really dying

40:20.890 --> 40:22.310
to work on something new.

40:22.670 --> 40:26.970
So in between, we'll definitely work on a new project.

40:27.450 --> 40:31.650
We've got a few of my old projects

40:31.650 --> 40:36.290
that before I learned the skill of finishing anything.

40:37.010 --> 40:39.170
So I've got a few of those I'd like to resurrect

40:39.170 --> 40:42.790
in the meantime that should be faster to make

40:42.790 --> 40:46.010
because A, we've got all the tech that we made for Good Boy

40:46.010 --> 40:50.090
and B, we've got a head start on some of the assets

40:50.090 --> 40:53.710
because I made this stuff years ago.

40:54.510 --> 40:59.210
And yeah, so we can make something faster than

40:59.210 --> 41:01.170
in two years' time this time.

41:01.610 --> 41:05.090
And then while working on that, we can start coming up

41:05.090 --> 41:09.210
with the bigger ideas or developing the bigger ideas

41:09.210 --> 41:11.930
that we have to work on other projects.

41:11.930 --> 41:16.010
And then maybe we'll come back around to Good Boy Galaxy

41:16.010 --> 41:17.390
and make a sequel.

41:18.050 --> 41:20.270
I think that sounds like a great idea.

41:20.490 --> 41:22.230
Work on something else in between.

41:22.990 --> 41:25.150
See how that goes as well.

41:25.330 --> 41:25.410
Yeah.

41:26.030 --> 41:27.990
A little palate cleanser.

41:28.710 --> 41:29.310
Yeah, exactly.

41:29.690 --> 41:35.510
I think back when we were doing 40-odd prototypes in a year

41:35.510 --> 41:38.990
and then doing one game in two years,

41:38.990 --> 41:42.690
I think there's a happy medium where we can have a few projects

41:42.690 --> 41:44.150
on the go, but they're smaller.

41:44.930 --> 41:50.590
And we've got some amount of work that's already

41:50.590 --> 41:51.430
been undertaken.

41:51.430 --> 41:56.650
So it's not quite the arduous task of Good Boy Galaxy.

41:58.270 --> 42:01.570
Yeah, so I think that's what we're thinking at the moment.

42:03.070 --> 42:07.090
You mentioned actually finishing projects.

42:07.090 --> 42:13.310
It's very common to not finish projects.

42:13.310 --> 42:16.590
I'm an expert at not finishing projects myself.

42:17.210 --> 42:25.250
So being locked in a physical medium where you have a release

42:25.250 --> 42:28.210
and you want to release and you have to do that well

42:28.210 --> 42:31.030
in advance, do you feel that that helped you finishing

42:31.030 --> 42:31.690
the game?

42:32.810 --> 42:36.090
Or did it make it harder?

42:39.370 --> 42:43.090
Yeah, I mean, to some degree, it's like, well,

42:43.610 --> 42:45.830
the deadline is now you have to deliver.

42:46.290 --> 42:47.210
There's a deliverable.

42:47.570 --> 42:48.090
You have to.

42:48.590 --> 42:50.670
You can't not do that.

42:50.930 --> 42:53.330
You can't be in breach of contract.

42:53.890 --> 42:57.550
And although technically the Kickstarter is you're

42:57.550 --> 43:02.690
not obligated, you're not guaranteed the reward,

43:03.390 --> 43:07.430
you don't want to upset such a large amount of people.

43:07.950 --> 43:08.590
Yeah, definitely.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.190
Yeah, exactly.

43:10.810 --> 43:16.510
So there's definitely obligations that need to be met,

43:16.650 --> 43:20.900
which can feel like a burden, but also definitely

43:21.890 --> 43:23.770
is a motivator.

43:26.510 --> 43:36.740
But yeah, I think it's just, yeah,

43:36.800 --> 43:39.720
like I said, it's not really a skill in itself.

43:39.940 --> 43:48.180
It's just a mindset to not spend all your time coming

43:48.180 --> 43:52.200
up with changing mind, making differing decisions

43:52.200 --> 43:58.680
and just always keep some momentum going.

43:59.240 --> 44:04.540
And then I think even the relatively big projects

44:04.540 --> 44:08.960
are achievable, whether it's timely or not.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.200
We underestimated the amount of time it would take

44:14.200 --> 44:15.700
by 100%.

44:15.700 --> 44:18.600
It took us twice as long as we thought.

44:18.600 --> 44:23.540
And somehow amongst our peers, that's not even bad.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.800
That's okay.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.840
That's actually pretty good.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.920
So yeah, just mindfuck should always be just keep

44:35.920 --> 44:38.840
some momentum, and then it'll get you there.

44:39.480 --> 44:45.800
I think a lot of developers say you should make small games,

44:46.360 --> 44:48.400
lots of small games, which is kind of what we did

44:48.400 --> 44:50.960
when we were working on prototypes,

44:51.240 --> 44:58.380
so many prototypes to kind of exercise that muscle

44:58.380 --> 45:00.020
of momentum.

45:00.920 --> 45:04.260
But I think what a lot of developers don't really

45:04.260 --> 45:09.780
talk about is it's kind of boring to work on small,

45:10.420 --> 45:13.580
uninteresting projects when there's the great,

45:13.580 --> 45:18.120
big magnum opus that everyone wants to work on.

45:18.920 --> 45:25.220
So I think really loving what you're doing is also

45:25.220 --> 45:27.540
a big motivator.

45:27.880 --> 45:31.880
So yeah, it's not as easy as it sounds when people say

45:31.880 --> 45:33.900
just work on 1,000 small projects.

45:35.260 --> 45:37.340
It's not the only part of the equation.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.260
Yeah, you definitely need to have the passion for it,

45:41.260 --> 45:43.400
because otherwise it's not going to get done.

45:45.300 --> 45:52.660
So looking at you, the studio, the game,

45:52.820 --> 45:55.960
as part of the indie gaming community,

45:56.360 --> 46:00.340
what are you excited about for the future of indie gaming?

46:00.480 --> 46:04.360
We see here a big revival, I think,

46:04.460 --> 46:08.660
of retro style and also retro games.

46:08.660 --> 46:14.400
But retro style has been in vogue for a good number

46:14.400 --> 46:15.220
of years now.

46:16.580 --> 46:18.280
And I love it.

46:18.460 --> 46:22.700
I'm a big, big fan of the retro style games.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.660
Do you think we'll see more of that,

46:25.900 --> 46:29.120
or will we move into a different type of genre?

46:32.140 --> 46:34.680
Yeah, I mean, I'm not really...

46:36.080 --> 46:39.040
I'm not sure that I'm the right person to really say.

46:39.180 --> 46:41.060
I'm not like...

46:41.680 --> 46:47.500
I'm not really abreast of all the trends on the consumer side.

46:48.060 --> 46:54.020
What I really enjoy is just watching what people are making

46:54.020 --> 46:57.480
and just taking it at face value and just enjoying it

46:57.480 --> 46:58.720
for what it is.

46:59.180 --> 47:03.680
So it's hard for me to forecast what the industry

47:03.680 --> 47:08.540
or the community is going to be doing next.

47:08.720 --> 47:14.040
But I think as long as people are making interesting stuff

47:14.040 --> 47:15.720
that they personally find interesting,

47:15.720 --> 47:21.120
I think that's always going to be where the gems come from.

47:23.060 --> 47:30.180
And I think if any particular style,

47:30.360 --> 47:33.080
like PlayStation 1 or games or something,

47:33.080 --> 47:35.560
which you sometimes...

47:36.080 --> 47:38.500
they seem to appear in small groups,

47:38.600 --> 47:40.360
I don't think...

47:40.360 --> 47:44.880
Although obviously people are inspired by each other's projects,

47:45.480 --> 47:46.900
I don't think anyone's thinking,

47:47.300 --> 47:52.380
I want to make a PlayStation 1 horror game just because I've seen...

47:52.380 --> 47:55.080
Just because they've proved that there's a market there.

47:55.220 --> 48:00.700
I think to make anything in this kind of hobby space,

48:00.700 --> 48:04.320
you have to really deep down want to make it.

48:04.460 --> 48:05.520
So I think...

48:05.520 --> 48:12.980
I don't know how applicable it is to kind of chase trends like it.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.500
Yeah, I just think they're so personal,

48:16.640 --> 48:20.080
which is what I love about the indie game space.

48:21.060 --> 48:23.760
Yeah, that's my opinion on it.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.740
I don't know if that's in spirit of the question.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.160
No, I think that's good.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.440
I think we see a lot of passion projects.

48:34.200 --> 48:38.340
And you can definitely tell when you're playing a game,

48:38.480 --> 48:41.460
you can tell that the person who made this game

48:41.460 --> 48:46.600
is proud of the game and had fun creating the game.

48:47.220 --> 48:47.860
Yeah, yeah.

48:48.700 --> 48:55.040
I think there's a lot to be unexcited about at the moment in indie gaming,

48:55.040 --> 49:01.780
like with Twitter deteriorating and Unity imploding.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.620
But in spirit of the question,

49:05.820 --> 49:11.880
in its kind of optimistic view,

49:12.040 --> 49:17.940
I think it maybe means there's a bit of a rebirth on the horizon,

49:18.100 --> 49:22.460
like there'll be a new place for community and marketing,

49:22.460 --> 49:28.300
and there'll be a new home for the Unity exiles.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.700
I really love Blender,

49:31.960 --> 49:36.720
so I'm really hoping that Godot becomes like the blender

49:36.720 --> 49:39.620
of game development software.

49:39.980 --> 49:45.000
I think, although it's not that much fun for a lot of people at the moment,

49:45.240 --> 49:46.940
maybe there's a bright future.

49:47.860 --> 49:54.420
And then, yeah, I mean, in terms of, yeah, like I say,

49:54.580 --> 49:57.580
what I'm really excited about is just people's personal projects.

49:57.920 --> 50:06.520
Like I love just scrolling through Twitter or Blue Sky or X, whatever,

50:07.100 --> 50:10.020
and just watching what people are making,

50:10.220 --> 50:12.140
and there's some really incredible stuff.

50:12.140 --> 50:17.980
There's someone called Kosefi, I think, Chun-Fai.

50:18.380 --> 50:24.220
They've been making a dungeon-faller game where you also play as a dog.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.480
So that's, yeah, that's something that I like.

50:27.560 --> 50:31.580
And it's just so, I think they're mainly a freelance artist,

50:31.720 --> 50:34.460
but they're just in their spare time, been doing this for years.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.340
It's so beautiful.

50:36.760 --> 50:40.600
Like it's just every note is just absolutely perfect.

50:40.600 --> 50:43.280
And every time that comes up on my Twitter feed,

50:43.320 --> 50:45.840
I'm just like, it makes my day feel a little bit better.

50:45.900 --> 50:48.020
And there's so many projects like that.

50:48.140 --> 50:50.820
And I think, yeah, that's what I'm really excited about.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.060
That's really cool.

50:53.420 --> 50:55.300
Rick, this has been fantastic.

50:55.560 --> 50:59.460
Thank you so much for talking to me today

50:59.460 --> 51:04.280
and showcasing Good Boy Galaxy, diving into the game,

51:04.460 --> 51:06.060
diving into you as a person.

51:06.780 --> 51:08.980
This has been really, really fun.

51:08.980 --> 51:13.000
Where can we find more information about Good Boy Galaxy,

51:13.280 --> 51:15.060
about you, your projects?

51:17.320 --> 51:23.480
So the best way to find the information is just go to our website,

51:23.620 --> 51:25.560
which is goodboygalaxy.com.

51:25.740 --> 51:29.440
And on that page, there's a link to our personal Twitters.

51:31.660 --> 51:35.460
And yeah, that's where all the info is.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.220
Fantastic.

51:37.220 --> 51:39.400
Thank you so much, Rick.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.360
Again, this has been fantastic.

51:41.720 --> 51:45.200
And thank you, everyone who has listened in or watched us.

51:45.700 --> 51:49.020
Have a fantastic week and see you all next time.

51:49.580 --> 51:50.000
Bye.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.760
Thank you very much.

51:51.760 --> 52:05.560
